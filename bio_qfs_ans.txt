The main purpose is to fill a gap in the study of DNA polymerases in vertebrate genomes by analyzing the role of mammalian pol ν.
There are 16 known DNA polymerases in vertebrate genomes.
Pol ν, encoded by the POLN gene, has not been studied through experiments with genetically disrupted mice.
Poln is uniquely upregulated during testicular development.
Poln is enriched in spermatocytes.
There was a modest reduction in meiotic recombination at a recombination hotspot in Poln-deficient mice.
Pol ν has been suggested to function in DNA crosslink repair.
No, there was no increased DNA crosslink sensitivity found in Poln-deficient mice or POLN-depleted human cells.
The main difference is that this study found no increased DNA crosslink sensitivity, unlike some previous findings.
The present work represents the first description and comprehensive analysis of mice deficient in pol ν and the first thorough phenotypic analysis in human cells.
Vaccines are considered a cost-effective way to control infectious diseases.
Antigens and adjuvants must be selected to trigger appropriate immune responses against a specific pathogen.
Dengue-2 envelope protein domain III was selected as the vaccine candidate.
The candidate dengue protein was expressed in the lipidated form in an Escherichia coli-based system.

12 million people worldwide are currently affected by visceral leishmaniasis.
CD8+ T cells can kill parasites and limit the disease.
The study of CD8+ T cells has been hindered because the specific parasite molecules they recognize are unknown.
The researchers engineered parasites to express ovalbumin, allowing them to track and measure immune cells targeted at ovalbumin.
The researchers found that CD8+ T cells initially divide and produce molecules such as IFN-gamma that may help them kill parasites.
The CD8+ T cells rapidly lost their effector function and died off as the infection progressed.
The researchers were able to recover some CD8+ T cell function by blocking immune inhibitory molecules induced by parasite infection.
The recovered CD8+ T cells were able to kill parasites and control infection.
These results could be important for the design of new therapeutic vaccine strategies aimed at inducing protective CD8+ T cells.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of diseases that include "mad cow" disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, characterized by abnormal folding of the prion protein (PrP) in the host.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are related to the abnormal folding of the prion protein (PrP). The misfolded PrP is implicated in the development of these diseases.
One hypothesis is that the protonation of a specific residue, H187, when the protein passes through acidic cell organelles, could destabilize PrP.
The simulations showed that the destabilization process can follow two alternative pathways, potentially resulting in different final structures.
The discovery suggests that the different strains observed in prion diseases may be encoded in the structure of the misfolded PrP, and the alternative pathways of destabilization may contribute to this variation.
The specific residue highlighted is R136, which interacts with the destabilization process of PrP.
No, the residue pair of R136 is not present in non-mammalian species that do not develop prion diseases.
Many aspects of the underlying molecular mechanism of these diseases, such as the abnormal folding of PrP, still remain elusive.
"Mad cow" disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are examples of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
The host protein associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is the prion protein (PrP).
Trachoma causes visual impairment through in-turned eyelashes (trichiasis) on the surface of the eye.
Epilation, intermittent plucking of lashes touching the eye, is a common traditional practice.
No, the long-term effectiveness of epilation in preventing visual impairment is unknown.
Eyelid surgery was the main treatment option evaluated.
1300 people with mild trichiasis in Ethiopia were included in the trial.
Mild trichiasis was defined as fewer than six lashes touching the eye.
The results were previously reported at two years after the intervention.
No, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of change in vision and corneal opacity.
Most participants in the epilation arm continued epilating to control their trichiasis.
The study suggests that good quality epilation can be a reasonable second-line alternative to surgery for individuals who either decline surgery or do not have immediate access to it.
The severe manifestations of dengue disease include dengue haemorrhagic fever, vascular leakage, and immune-mediated reactions.
The dengue virus interacts with macrophages, dendritic cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells.
The macrophage mannose receptor plays an important role in mediating the infection of human macrophages by the dengue virus.
Type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 enhance macrophage susceptibility to DV infection.
The vascular leakage associated with dengue haemorrhagic fever is believed to be immune-mediated.
Understanding DV-receptor interactions is important to comprehend the mechanisms of entry, infection biology, and pathogenesis of dengue disease.
The goal of understanding the immunopathogenesis of dengue disease is to develop a safe dengue vaccine and therapeutic inhibitors of early DV replication.
DV infection of target cells leads to the production of new virions.
Dengue disease is a growing public health concern because a large percentage of the world's population lives in dengue-endemic areas.
Recent advances have been made in understanding DV interactions with target cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells.
The focus is to better understand the brain.
Most simulations investigate spontaneous neural dynamics in the absence of tasks, sensory input, or motor output.

Embodying the model radically changes how the model operates and how we understand the computational mechanisms.
The authors observe interesting brain-environment feedback interactions.
The presence of brain-environment feedback requires different homeostatic systems to compensate for it.
The effects are observed in both the simulated neural dynamics and the behavior of the embodied agent.
The findings suggest novel functional roles for homeostatic systems in maintaining neural dynamics and behavior.

The intervention costs were compared to the economic and health benefits due to the avoidance of clinical cases.
The optimal timing is centered on the month of July, corresponding to the period of maximal growth of the mosquito population.
Municipality-wide interventions are likely to be cost-effective in small-to-medium towns below 35,000 inhabitants, even with moderate mosquito infestation.
For larger cities, a neighborhood-based intervention should be considered.
Yes, involving citizens to apply larvicides within private premises resulted in effectiveness.
Generally, involving citizens was considered costly because of the associated expenses.
The study focused on municipalities in temperate areas in Europe, specifically in Northern Italy.
The most fundamental function supported by biosonar is swift and effortless obstacle avoidance.
We still do not know which acoustic cues bats actually exploit while avoiding obstacles.
The simulations suggest that the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) and travel time of the first millisecond of the echo train, in combination with alternating ear positions, provide robust and reliable cues for obstacle avoidance.
Simple phonotaxis can steer a bat clear from obstacles without requiring a 3D reconstruction of the scene layout.
This paper provides the first computationally explicit explanation for obstacle avoidance in realistic and complex 3D environments.
Bats may comply with the hard real-time constraints of obstacle avoidance by using low-level yet robust cues for obstacle avoidance.

Metabolism is responsible for transforming available resources into energy currency and building blocks in living organisms.
Different organisms have varying metabolic pathways and input/output requirements to adapt to specific environments and strategies for survival and reproduction.
The text suggests that beneath the complex wiring of metabolic networks, it may be possible to discern signatures of optimal pathway architectures.
The text states that a systematic search for optimal pathways between all possible pairs of input and output molecules in real organic chemistry is computationally intractable.
The text suggests that a simple artificial chemistry resembling a single atom version of real biochemistry can be used to implement a search for optimal pathways.
Optimal pathways in the idealized chemistry exhibit a logarithmic dependence of pathway length on input/output molecule size and recurring topologies, including autocatalytic cycles.

The purpose of the method is to infer migration rates and population sizes across space in recent time periods.
The method introduced in the text differs from EEMS in terms of the models used (coalescent vs resistance), the data used (haplotype vs average genetic distance), and the ability to separately estimate migration rates and population sizes.
The novel method uses haplotype data.
The use of haplotype data allows the method to separately estimate migration rates and population sizes, and infer demography associated with different recent time periods.
The method is called MAPS, which stands for "Migration And Population-size Surfaces.".
2224 individuals of European ancestry were analyzed.
The "Voronoi" prior is used to regularize parameters of the model.
The method uses a recombination rate map to calibrate the decay of haplotypes over time.
The two key differences are the models used (coalescent vs resistance) and the type of data used (haplotype vs average genetic distance).
The useful feature of haplotype data is that, by varying the lengths analyzed, it allows the inference of demography associated with different recent time periods.
Insulin resistance is a chronic condition characterized by reduced sensitivity to the effects of circulating insulin.
Insulin resistance can be observed in otherwise healthy individuals after severe trauma, hemorrhage, or sepsis.
Insulin resistance may play a physiological role in modulating the response to injury.
Defective insulin signals are linked to impaired wound healing.
The study uses the liver as a model to assess how insulin resistance affects the injury response in mice.
The study provides proof of concept that insulin signals are locally integrated by the fibrotic microenvironment surrounding the adult liver stem cells during chronic injury.
Insulin resistance disrupts the local paracrine circuit, resulting in a blunted epithelial response to chronic injury.
Disrupted paracrine circuit due to insulin resistance exacerbates tissue damage during chronic injury.
Insulin primes stem cells to respond to stromal growth factors, leading to increased participation in epithelial repair.
The study provides a new perspective suggesting that insulin resistance influences the hepatic injury response, switching it from a stromal repair process to an epithelial repair process.
Sensory neurons are specialized cells that detect and transmit sensory information to the brain. They sample their environment through highly branched structures called dendritic arbors or trees.
The precise patterning of dendritic arbors is important for the proper functioning of the nervous system.
Evidence suggests that sensory neurons may be involved in neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism spectrum disorders.
The unfolded protein response is a cellular process that ensures a functional protein-folding environment in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum.
The unfolded protein response is compromised in a number of neurodegenerative conditions.
Yes, the function of the unfolded protein response in dendrite patterning is evolutionarily conserved from the roundworm C. elegans to mammals.
Dendrites in both worms and mammals require the function of a conserved enzyme with both kinase and ribonuclease activity.
The loss of this enzyme can be bypassed by reducing the signaling through the insulin-like growth factor receptor.
The findings suggest a new way of bypassing defects in the unfolded protein response during dendrite development.
The main findings of the research reveal that the unfolded protein response is involved in dendrite patterning and that its function is conserved from C. elegans to mammals. Loss of the required enzyme can be bypassed by reducing signaling through the insulin-like growth factor receptor.
The central role of NAD+ is to shuttle electrons from the oxidation of growth substrates to respiratory or fermentative pathways.
To sustain catabolism and meet cellular ATP demand, a balanced ratio between the reduced and oxidized forms of NAD+ needs to be maintained.
ArcA mediates a comprehensive repression of genes encoding proteins associated with the oxidation of non-fermentable carbon sources, preserving oxidized NAD+ for fermentation pathways.
Repressing genes involved in the oxidation of non-fermentable carbon sources helps preserve oxidized NAD+ for fermentation pathways, facilitating energy conservation.
In the absence of aerobic respiration, repression of non-fermentable carbon source oxidation pathways helps maintain a balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of NAD+.
The majority of ArcA binding sites contain additional sequence elements beyond what is required for binding of an ArcA dimer.
The analysis reveals how ArcA, and other members of the OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators, can achieve global regulation of gene expression.
NAD+ helps shuttle electrons during the oxidation of growth substrates, allowing for the production of ATP through respiratory or fermentative pathways.
NAD+ helps preserve energy by shuttling electrons towards fermentation pathways when aerobic respiration is not possible.
Maintaining a balance ensures that catabolism is sustained, cellular ATP demand is met, and energy conservation pathways are efficiently utilized.
Previous studies showed that Rb+/− mice develop pituitary adenomas.
No, RB1 mutations have not been found in human pituitary tumors.
The present study uncovered a novel genetic pathway that may lead to Rb downregulation through RNA splicing mediated by usp39.
Usp39 is involved in the assembly of the spliceosome, a complex involved in RNA splicing.
The forward genetic study in zebrafish suggested that the loss of usp39 results in aberrant rb1 mRNA splicing.
Aberrant rb1 mRNA splicing likely causes elevated expression of its target gene e2f4.
E2f4 is known to have oncogenic activity when overexpressed.
The upregulation of e2f4 is the main factor responsible for adenohypophyseal cell lineage hyperplasia in the zebrafish usp39 mutant.
It would be of interest to investigate if mutations or downregulation of USP39 would contribute to pituitary tumorigenesis in humans.
The main focus of the study is to uncover a genetic pathway involving usp39 and its effects on rb1 mRNA splicing and the expression of the e2f4 gene, which may contribute to pituitary tumorigenesis.

Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
Clostridium difficile persists in the environment, including hospitals, through the production of resistant spores.
Clostridium difficile transmission is mediated by the contamination of the gut by spores.
Understanding the regulation of Clostridium difficile's developmental process is fundamental to decipher its transmission and pathogenesis.
Clostridium difficile shows a less tight connection between the forespore and mother cell lines of gene expression compared to Bacillus subtilis, especially in the late sigma factor, σK.
The sigK gene in Clostridium difficile is interrupted by a prophage-like intervening sequence called skinCd.
CD1231, a large serine recombinase, is required for the excision of skinCd in Clostridium difficile.
The synthesis of the recombination directionality factor is detected only in the mother cell of Clostridium difficile.
Deletion of skinCd in Clostridium difficile results in premature σK activity and the production of spores with altered surface layers.
The alteration of spore surface layers in Clostridium difficile might be important for host colonization.

The genetic factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*5701.
Yes, the risk of progression to AIDS also varies among patients carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele.
The study mentioned in the text focused on the interplay between HIV-1 evolutionary rate variation and the risk of disease progression in HLA-B*5701 subjects.
The researchers analyzed the viral sequences using advanced computational biology techniques based on coalescent Bayesian methods.
The association found was that lower synonymous substitution rates were associated with higher baseline CD4+ T cell counts in HLA-B*5701 subjects.
Synonymous rates, which are proportional to in vivo viral replication rates, can be used as a potential novel evolutionary marker of disease progression.
The clinical course of HIV-1 infection is characterized by considerable variability in the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients with different genetic backgrounds.
Advanced computational biology techniques based on coalescent Bayesian methods were used to analyze the viral sequences in the study.
The HLA-B*5701 subjects were followed from early infection up to the onset of AIDS in the study.
The findings could have a translational impact on clinical practice, as synonymous rates could be used as a novel evolutionary marker of disease progression.
The main parasites responsible for human and animal trypanosomiases are Trypanosoma brucei.
Human and animal trypanosomiases are major burdens in rural sub-Saharan Africa.
The number of infected humans has been decreasing in recent decades.
Emerging resistance and adverse side effects against commonly used drugs make it necessary to find new drug targets and develop new drugs.
TbMCP14 was identified as a potential drug target through an unbiased genome-wide screen searching for genes involved in the mode of action of trypanocidal compounds.
TbMCP14 is suggested to mediate the action of a group of anti-parasitic choline analogs against T. brucei.
Ablation or deletion of TbMCP14 decreases the susceptibility of parasites towards the trypanocidal compounds.
Over-expression of TbMCP14 has the opposite effect, increasing the susceptibility of parasites towards the trypanocidal compounds.
Down-regulation of TbMCP14 protects mitochondria from drug-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.
TbMCP14 is suggested to be involved in energy production in T. brucei, possibly by acting as a mitochondrial proline carrier.
The current understanding is that GPCRs have at least one endogenous ligand for the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins that control various physiological functions.
Approximately 140 out of 800 GPCRs are referred to as orphan receptors due to a lack of knowledge about their endogenous ligands.
Orphan receptors attract interest because their endogenous ligands are unknown, making them potential targets for drug discovery and medical research.
The study suggests that the "ligand-receptor" model probably cannot be applied to all GPCRs.
Placental mammalian BRS3 is constitutively active, while nonplacental vertebrate BRS3 connects to its original ligands (neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide).
The analysis and data suggest that placental mammalian BRS3, including human BRS3, lost connection with its original ligands during placental mammalian evolution.
The proposal is that a significant number of orphan GPCRs do not have endogenous ligands and represent a genuinely orphan group that will never be deorphanized by the discovery of a natural ligand.
The findings may provide new perspectives and insights into the ligand-driven deorphanization of GPCRs.
The findings suggest that there is a distinct group of orphan GPCRs that may require alternative approaches for therapeutic targeting and drug development.
The study contributes to the understanding of GPCR biology by highlighting the existence of orphan GPCRs that lack endogenous ligands, expanding the scope of GPCR research and potential drug targets.

The goal is to encourage the use of the framework by providing accessibility and ease of use to the scientific community.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite.
No, Toxoplasma gondii is not able to replicate outside the host cell.
Toxoplasma gondii lives in a specialized parasitophorous vacuole in contact with the host cytoplasm through the parasitophorous vacuole membrane.
Isoprenoids are abundant lipidic compounds essential to many cellular processes including signaling, trafficking, energy metabolism, and protein translation.
There is evidence for an active exchange of metabolites between Toxoplasma gondii and the host cell, particularly for isoprenoids.
Intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites are able to salvage farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and/or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from the host.
Yes, T. gondii tachyzoites can still grow even when their endogenous production of isoprenoids is shut down.
Extracellular T. gondii depends entirely on its own production of isoprenoids.
The proposed therapeutic approach against Toxoplasma gondii involves using a combination of inhibitors that would target both the host and parasite pathways.
Yes, the proposed therapeutic approach could also potentially work against other Apicomplexan parasites.

Sigatoka disease is one of the most destructive diseases affecting banana crops worldwide.
Pathoadaptive changes in virulence-associated genes, such as those encoding for effectors, contribute to the differences in virulence spectra among the three species.
Changes in the size of gene families associated with nutrient acquisition and assimilation are more respectful of the species' virulence profiles.
The increase in virulence of P. eumusae and P. fijiensis is proposed to be driven by convergent evolution in metabolic pathways that enhance nutrient acquisition, uptake, and utilization.
The main aim is to understand the biological process of disease emergence.
The authors employed comparative genome analyses to compare the genomes of different Pseudocercospora species.
It can lead to the development of new and effective disease control methods.

The mechanisms are poorly understood because there is a lack of knowledge regarding the immunological processes linked to the progression of the disease or protective mechanisms.
The researchers used a data-driven approach to gain insights into the immunological processes linked to the disease progression or protective mechanisms.
The peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients with visceral leishmaniasis, individuals who remained asymptomatic, patients recovering from disease after treatment, and uninfected individuals.
The researchers employed computational analysis to evaluate the blood transcriptional activity of each group.
Yes, the transcriptional signatures identified in this study correlated with previous findings obtained through different analytical methods.
The analyses uncovered previously unidentified molecular pathways and gene networks associated with the transcriptional profiles of individuals recovering from disease or those who did not develop symptoms after infection.
The discovery suggests that the activation of protective responses could be useful targets for the development of new therapies for visceral leishmaniasis.
Individuals who are recovering from the disease or those who did not develop symptoms after infection could be potential targets for new therapies.
This study's approach focuses on obtaining insights into the immunological processes linked to disease progression and protective mechanisms.
Exploitative individuals can perform fewer cooperative behaviors while still reaping the benefits obtained from others' cooperative behavior.
Conflict of interest can arise when cooperating individuals have conflicting preferences or goals, leading to the evolution of complex social strategies.
The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is used as a model to study partner-specific conflict and cooperation.
When faced with starvation, free-living amoebae aggregate and form a fruiting body composed of dead stalk cells and spores.
Different genotypes within chimeric fruiting bodies may have conflicting interests over who will contribute to the reproductive sporehead and who will sacrifice themselves to produce the dead stalk.
The outcomes of competitive interactions in chimera appear complex, with social success being strongly partner specific.
The proposed mechanism involves the production of and response to stalk-inducing factors, which are social signals that determine whether cells become stalk or spore.
Yes, measurements of signal production and response can predict social behavior in different strains of D. discoideum.
The study suggests that a simple underlying mechanistic basis, such as the production and response to social signals, can account for the natural variation in complex facultative social strategies.
Yes, complex and unpredictable behavioral outcomes can arise when the underlying social rules are unknown, even though simple social rules are sufficient to generate these outcomes.
Proteins destined for secretion are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum either directly upon translation on the ER surface or post-translationally.
The mechanism by which mRNAs encoding mSMPs target the ER is not clear.
The signal recognition particle (SRP) targets nascent polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized receptor.
Previous studies have suggested that the SRP mediates the co-translational ER targeting of mRNA, specifically by recognizing N-terminal hydrophobic signals on nascent polypeptides.
More recent studies have shown that SRP inactivation and translation inhibition do not prevent targeting of mSMPs to the ER, suggesting that the process may be translation-independent.

Biofuels research is focused on understanding the energy-related metabolic capabilities of different biological species.
The genome of Rhodococcus opacus PD630 was sequenced because it has the unique ability to accumulate around 80% of its cellular dry weight in oil, which is a rare trait in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms.
The genome of R. opacus PD630 is 9.27 Mb in size.
The presence of numerous homologous genes dedicated to lipid metabolism in R. opacus PD630 makes it difficult to perform a complete and accurate metabolic reconstruction based solely on the genome sequence.
The researchers developed a multidisciplinary approach that involved identifying uncommon straight-chain odd-carbon lipid biosynthesis and conducting a catabolic screen for growth substrates to refine the sequence-based metabolic reconstruction.
The comparative analysis of R. opacus PD630 genome sequence with related species provided insights into how this bacterium became such a remarkable producer of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and helped identify a set of biofuels target genes for this group of bacteria.
The synthesis of genome sequence and phenotypic information supports a model for the genetic basis for prokaryotic oleaginy and provides crucial insights for engineering next-generation biofuels with genes conserved in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms.
The ability of R. opacus PD630 to accumulate around 80% of its cellular dry weight in oil is a rare trait in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms.

The main gene involved in regulating the development of gonads in vertebrates is dmrt1.
The expression pattern of dmrt1 genes in gonads is controlled in a timely and spatially controlled manner.
Besides transcriptional regulation, a sequence motif located in the 3' UTR (D3U-box) mediates the stability of dmrt1 mRNA.
No, the regulation of dmrt1 mRNA stability is not well understood, and the mechanisms are barely understood.
The fish model medaka was used in the study to analyze dmrt1 regulation.
Two RNA-binding proteins are involved in the regulation of dmrt1 through the D3U-box.
The RNA-binding proteins have antagonizing properties and target the D3U-box, promoting either RNA stabilization in germ cells or degradation in the soma.
No, the conservation of the D3U-box motif is not limited to fishes. It is suggested that this mechanism for controlling RNA stability might also apply to other vertebrates.
No, the expression patterns of the RNA binding proteins are preserved in subsets of germ cells, suggesting that they are not exclusively observed in fish germ cells.
The new mechanism for controlling RNA stability is described as complex and barely understood.
Understanding the egg stage of mosquitoes can contribute to the development of novel strategies for mosquito control and hampering disease transmission.
Mosquitoes lay their eggs in water collections, including some temporary ones.
Mosquito eggs during early embryogenesis are prone to losing water, which can lead to dehydration and death.
The serosal cuticle, produced during embryogenesis, wraps the embryo and contributes to protecting the egg, allowing it to survive outside the water.
Egg resistance to water loss varies among mosquitoes, with Aedes eggs able to survive outside water for long periods, Anopheles eggs for intermediate periods, and Culex eggs for short periods.
Darker eggs with more melanin exhibit greater resistance against water loss.
The relationship was confirmed by studying a mosquito mutant that does not melanize properly. This mutant had decreased survival outside the water.
The protection conferred by melanin is dependent on the formation of the serosal cuticle.
The results of this study contribute to the study of the evolution of egg coloration in insects by identifying one of the reasons why Aedes aegypti eggs can survive outside water for several months.
Blocking the vector life cycle of mosquitoes can be an effective way to hamper disease transmission, as mosquitoes transmit various causative agents of diseases.
The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that infection with helminths increases susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.
Rhesus macaques were used as the animal model.
A clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus was used.
Monkeys with acute Schistosoma mansoni infection required exposure to 17-fold lower levels of the virus to become infected with HIV-1.

Loss of a certain subset of memory T cells in schistosome-infected monkeys is a predictor of a more rapid progression to immune dysfunction.
The results suggest that worm infections may increase the risk of HIV-1 infection among individuals with viral exposures.
Controlling schistosomiasis and other worm infections may help reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in developing countries where helminths are endemic.

The segmentation clock plays an important role in suppressing the noise effect to achieve reproducible somite formation.
The main focus of the computational model is to understand the emergence and reduction of irregular somites in somitogenesis.
The two main questions are: How do irregular somites emerge in a clock-independent manner, and how is the irregularity reduced in the presence of the clock?
A protein's three-dimensional structure is crucial for its function as it provides specific dynamic features for catalytic and binding events.

Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is prevalent mostly in South America.
Serological tests are used as rapid, simple, and inexpensive tools for the diagnosis and follow-up of PCM.
Six Brazilian reference centers participated in the study.
Each center provided 30 sera of PCM patients for the study.
The "reference" titers of the sera were defined as positive high, intermediate, and low titers.
Each center applied its serological routine test to the 150 sera from the other five centers blindly.
The mean rate of discordant scores in the 150 sera tested was 31.
A mean of 14.8 sera in 30 presented a discordance with at least one other center.
The inconsistencies among the laboratories could potentially result in conflicting information regarding the patient's treatment.
Renewed efforts should be promoted to improve the standardization of the serological diagnosis of PCM.
Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a parasitic skin disease caused by animal hookworm larvae that penetrate the skin and migrate aimlessly in the epidermis.
CLM is common in developing countries with hot climates.
In resource-poor settings, CLM is associated with considerable morbidity.
Hookworm larvae cannot penetrate the basal membrane, so they migrate aimlessly in the epidermis.
The intensity of CLM infection is high, particularly in the rainy season.
CLM tracks are very itchy and surrounded by significant skin inflammation.
Bacterial superinfection is common and intensifies the inflammation associated with CLM.
No, the psychosocial consequences caused by CLM have never been investigated.

American Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a tropical disease caused by the infection of Leishmania infantum, mainly transmitted through the bite of female sand flies, specifically the Lutzomyia longipalpis species.
It is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected female sand flies (Lutzomyia longipalpis).
The spread of American Visceral leishmaniasis in some countries has been associated with factors like human migration, precarious urbanization, and vector adaptation to urban areas.
No, control measures such as the elimination of infected dogs, application of residual insecticides, and environmental management have not resulted in a significant reduction in American Visceral leishmaniasis incidence in Brazil.
Understanding the bionomic parameters of vector populations is critical for comprehending the transmission dynamics of American Visceral leishmaniasis and evaluating prevention and control measures.
The mark-release-recapture (MRR) method was applied to evaluate bionomic parameters of a population of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex.
The findings of the study indicated a high survival rate and low population dispersal of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex.
Measures applied to dog populations, such as preventing sand fly bites, may contribute to the reduction of the surviving vector population indirectly by reducing the host biting rate.
The low dispersal observed suggests that environmental management could contribute to the reduction of vector density, as it can restrict the movement and spread of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex.
The data obtained in this study provides the first estimates of vector survival rates for populations of the sibling species Lu. longipalpis under natural conditions. This information can be applied in the evaluation of prevention and control measures for American Visceral leishmaniasis.

Understanding gene expression patterns in mammalian development is fundamental for understanding how cells differentiate and develop into specific cell types.
Histone variants, such as H2A.Z, play a key role in regulating chromatin states by replacing core histones and modulating gene expression.
H2A.Z is essential for embryonic development and plays a crucial role in the proper execution of developmental gene expression programs during cellular specification.
ESCs can generate an unlimited number of equivalent descendants and have the capacity to differentiate into any cell type. This makes them suitable for investigating the function of H2A.Z during lineage commitment.
We have limited knowledge about how the differences in divergent regions of H2A.Z contribute to chromatin regulation.
The unique H2A.Z acidic patch domain is necessary for regulating lineage commitment during ESC differentiation.
The text does not provide an explicit answer to this question.
The work described in the text provides a critical foundation for understanding the significance of H2A.Z incorporation in cell fate determination.
These findings are particularly important because H2A.Z has been implicated in various diseased conditions, including cancer.
The replacement of core histones with histone variants has recently emerged as a key mechanism for regulating chromatin states.
The purpose of lineage tracing methods is to study the behavior and dynamics of stem cells and tissues in vivo.
The study uses microsatellite mutations accumulated during the mouse's life to reconstruct cell lineage trees.
The researchers focused on the intestinal epithelium because its stem cells have been extensively studied, and various tracing methods have provided insights into their dynamics.
The three previously established facts confirmed in this study are the existence of "monoclonal conversion," the absence of an immortal strand mechanism in colon stem cells, and the separation of the colon into small domains with a common ancestor.
The study revealed that the colon's lineage is separate from other lineages such as the hematopoietic and pancreatic lineages.
The work presents a new approach to studying stem cell dynamics and can be applied to studying stem cell dynamics in other systems.
Lineage tracing methods rely on the presence of specific markers to track the lineage and behavior of stem cells and tissues.
Stem cells have a crucial role in tissue dynamics as they are responsible for maintaining and repairing tissues by differentiating into specialized cell types.

The two diseases transmitted by tsetse flies are African sleeping sickness and nagana.
Tsetse flies acquire the parasites when they feed on an infected host.
The parasites undergo multiplication in the fly gut and migrate to the salivary glands.
The infected tsetse fly transmits the parasites to another host through its saliva when feeding.
The study compared gene expression changes between parasitized and uninfected tsetse salivary glands.
Host proteins associated with stress and cell division were found to be increased in expression during parasite infections.
Parasite infections were found to reduce the expression of the most highly expressed salivary gland-specific secreted proteins.
The modification of saliva composition suggests that parasite infections alter the composition of tsetse fly saliva.
The parasite transcriptome revealed changes in specific cell surface proteins.
The parasite showed changes in metabolism related to glucose-amino acid utilization in different host environments.
Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by Leishmania infantum and L. donovani.
Current treatments for visceral leishmaniasis suffer from toxicity, variable efficacy, requirements for parenteral administration, and lengthy treatment regimens.
Actinobacterial strains, such as Streptomyces, have been a source of naturally derived antibiotics, as well as anticancer, anthelmintic, and antifungal drugs.
These microorganisms produce small molecules important in symbiotic interactions with insects, such as fungus-growing ants, fungus-growing termites, beetles, and wasps, against pathogens.
The objective of the described work is to show an ecologic approach for drug discovery and the identification of antileishmanial natural products from the fungus-growing ant ecosystem.
The two compounds isolated from Streptomyces strains showed potent activity against L. donovani.
The potency of the compounds isolated from Streptomyces strains was higher than the positive control (miltefosine).
The compounds isolated from Streptomyces strains demonstrated high selectivity indexes.
Leishmania infantum and L. donovani are the primary organisms responsible for causing visceral leishmaniasis.
Visceral leishmaniasis has a high mortality rate worldwide.
Trypanosomes are single-celled organisms transmitted by tsetse fly that cause sleeping sickness in humans and infect other mammals.
Trypanosomes are transmitted by the biting tsetse fly.
Sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes affects humans in sub-Saharan Africa.
No, most trypanosomes cannot infect humans as they die in human serum. However, two mutants of Trypanosoma brucei have evolved the ability to survive in human serum.
Survival in human serum is conferred by the presence of a specific gene in the East African human-infective T. b. rhodesiense.
The frequency of genetic material exchange among trypanosomes is debated, but it affects the spread of genes, including those that confer human infectivity, through the population.
The researchers studied T. b. rhodesiense populations in different geographic locations, including Malawi and two locations in Uganda.
The purpose was to assess the stability and diversity of T. b. rhodesiense populations over time, specifically in Uganda.
Yes, there were significant differences in diversity between locations. The populations in Uganda were very closely related, increasingly so over time. In contrast, the Malawi population was genetically diverse.
A greater understanding of T. b. rhodesiense population evolution can provide valuable insights into the epidemiology of sleeping sickness, aiding in its prevention and control.
The brain's ability to perform cognitive processes depends on the specific connections between neurons.
Information is carried between neurons as spikes that are transmitted via connections with different strengths and propagation delays.
Experimentally observed learning rules can modify the strengths of connections between neurons.
Learning in neuronal networks is vital for creating the structures necessary for different cognitive processes and memory.
The spiking rates of populations of neurons have been observed to oscillate at specific frequencies in various brain regions.
There is evidence that oscillations play a role in cognition.
Connections with propagation delays that resonate with oscillations are strengthened relative to other connections.
Networks learn to oscillate more strongly to oscillations at the frequency they were presented with during learning.
Analytical and numerical methods are used to investigate the changes in network structure.
The possible application of these results to specific areas of the brain is discussed.
Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is caused by Leishmania infantum.
Leishmania infantum can be delivered by pool blood feeding zoo-anthropophilic phlebotomine flies.
The main reservoir for ZVL is the dog population.
ZVL is transmitted from infected dogs to humans through the bite of female phlebotomine sand flies.
Brazil has a high prevalence of ZVL cases.
Culling sero-positive dogs has been the main, inefficient, and highly controversial control measure for ZVL in Brazil.
The community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs is proposed as an alternative control measure for L. infantum transmission.
Phlebotomine flies that sampled their blood meals from dogs treated with systemic insecticides would die, reducing the risk of L. infantum transmission.
Parameters such as insecticide efficacy, duration, and proportion of dogs treated are key factors that need to be considered for the new vector control strategy to be effective.
The mathematical model showed that the novel vector control strategy could be effective in reducing the risk of L. infantum infection in humans, based on the identified combination of different key parameters.
The clinical symptoms of malaria are attributed to the blood stage of the parasite life cycle, specifically the invasion and multiplication of Plasmodium merozoites within host erythrocytes.
The parasite proteins that mediate molecular interactions are localized in membrane-bound internal organelles called micronemes and rhoptries, located at the apical end of Plasmodium merozoites.
Timely secretion of microneme and rhoptry proteins to the merozoite surface allows receptor binding, which is a crucial step in the invasion process.
Exposure of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites to low potassium ion concentrations, as found in blood plasma, triggers a rise in intracellular calcium, which in turn triggers the secretion of microneme proteins to the merozoite surface.
Binding of released microneme proteins with erythrocyte receptors provides the signal for the release of rhoptry proteins.
The analysis of signal transduction pathways involved in apical organelle secretion could lead to a clear understanding of these pathways and enable the development of inhibitors that block secretion of key parasite proteins required for receptor binding.
Inhibitors that block parasite protein secretion would block erythrocyte invasion and inhibit parasite growth, providing promising leads for the development of novel drugs against malaria.
The blood stage of the parasite life cycle, specifically the invasion and multiplication of Plasmodium merozoites within host erythrocytes, is responsible for the clinical symptoms of malaria.
The parasite proteins that mediate molecular interactions with erythrocytes are localized in membrane-bound organelles called micronemes and rhoptries, located at the apical end of Plasmodium merozoites.
The rise in intracellular calcium triggered by exposure to low potassium ions leads to the secretion of microneme proteins to the merozoite surface.
Tumor vessels are leaky and lack organization.
The consequence is insufficient blood supply and high fluid pressure inside the tumor.
Insufficient blood supply and high fluid pressure result in a reduced delivery of drugs within the tumor, especially in the tumor center.
The suggested treatment strategy is to use anti-vascular drugs.
Anti-vascular drugs are expected to make tumor vessels more normal.
Drug delivery can be improved by enhancing the physical transport of drugs.
The mathematical model is built to simulate tumor and vessel growth as well as fluid pressure inside the tumor.
The framework enables researchers to simulate drug treatment scenarios on tumors.
The simulations show that anti-vascular drugs enhance drug release into tumor tissue and improve drug distribution, particularly in the central regions of the tumor.
The application of anti-vascular drugs enhances drug distribution, allowing drug release in the central regions of the tumor.
Dendritic cells are one of the initial targets of HIV-1 infection and can influence the course of the virus's spread in the body.
HIV-1 can interfere with the normal function of dendritic cells, allowing the virus to spread more effectively.
The trans infection pathway is a process in which dendritic cells capture HIV-1 particles without getting infected themselves and subsequently pass these infectious particles to CD4+ T cells.
Siglec-1 or CD169, expressed on the surface of dendritic cells, is responsible for capturing HIV-1 particles by binding to the ganglioside GM3 present in the virus's lipid bilayer.
The interaction between CD169 and GM3 leads to the retention of virus particle infectivity within dendritic cells by targeting them to non-degradative compartments.
HIV-1 particles are transported to the synaptic junctions between dendritic cells and T cells and transferred to the T cells, leading to productive infection.
This interaction is a novel host-encoded mechanism that drives the spread of HIV-1 and can potentially be targeted for the development of new antiviral therapies.
Dendritic cells have sentinel functions that are crucial for establishing an antiviral state in the body, helping to defend against viral infections.
Dendritic cells initiate cellular contacts with CD4+ T cells to transfer the captured HIV-1 particles.
Understanding how dendritic cells capture and retain virus particles can provide insights into developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat HIV-1 infection.

A total of 9,984 ticks were analyzed in the study.
The ticks were collected from vegetation or feeding mammals in Jiangsu province, an endemic area in China.
The SFTSV-RNA was identified in larvae of Haemaphysalis longicornis.
No, the Haemaphysalis longicornis larvae were collected from vegetation without being blood-fed.

To study how an initial infection with H3N8 affects later infections, duration of infection, virus load, and antibody responses.
Yes, there was complete protection based on virus isolation.
Yes, there was partial protection induced by H3N8 pre-challenge to other subtypes.
It is a type of immunity that results in significantly shorter infections and reduction in viral load when challenged with different IAV subtypes.
The H4N5 subtype conferred the highest protection.
They were genetically related.
The results help understand naturally occurring subtype diversity and potential outcomes associated with the introduction of novel viruses like highly pathogenic IAV H5 viruses in wild bird populations.
The short generation time and the ability to exchange genetic material through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT).
Plasmids are autonomously replicating units found in bacteria, and they can carry genes that can be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria. They contribute significantly to HGT.
Conjugation is the process through which plasmids are transferred from one bacterium to another. Many plasmids contain antibiotic resistance genes, so conjugation plays a major role in spreading antibiotic resistance.
Understanding the regulation of conjugation genes is crucial for designing strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance.
The native plasmid pLS20 from Bacillus subtilis has been studied.
Bacillus subtilis is a soil bacterium and a gut commensal in animals and humans.
The presence of plasmid-free recipient cells triggers the activation of pLS20 conjugation genes.
The repressor protein keeps conjugation in an 'OFF' state, preventing its activation.
The activity of the anti-repressor is inhibited by a pLS20-encoded peptide that is secreted from the cell. .
The signaling-peptide, which is secreted by the cell and absorbed by other cells after a secondary processing step, dictates when conjugation genes become activated.
The primary mode of transmission for the dengue virus is through Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
The main approach to preventing dengue is through the control of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector.
It is not well known why some mosquito strains are susceptible to dengue virus infection while others are refractory or resistant to it.
The researchers conducted whole genome microarray-based gene expression studies to analyze gene expression patterns.
The analysis showed that a large number of genes were involved in a highly coordinated manner, either to host or defend against the dengue virus.
Genes responding to dengue infection were clustered into seven expression modules.
Genes associated with susceptibility to dengue infection were largely clustered in one expression module.
Genes associated with refractoriness to dengue infection were distributed in four distinct modules.
Yes, there was a common core set of genes expressed in both susceptible and refractory individuals.
Some of the specific pathways identified include energy metabolism and DNA replication in the susceptible response, and cell growth and death in the refractory response.
The scientific name for the parasite causing loiasis is Loa loa.
Loa loa is endemic in forest areas of west and central Africa.
Loa loa is also known as African eye worm.
Loa loa co-exists with onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF) in some endemic areas.
Ivermectin can provide benefits for individuals suffering from onchocerciasis by helping to control the disease.
Individuals co-infected with L. loa have a risk of developing serious side-effects when taking ivermectin.
Mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin has been ongoing in areas where onchocerciasis and loiasis overlap.
Ivermectin is also effective against loiasis.
The assessment focuses on the impact of CDTI on loiasis, specifically regarding the relationship between treatment adherence and the risk of developing severe complications after ivermectin treatment.
The feasibility of eliminating onchocerciasis and/or LF in areas endemic for L. loa using ivermectin as the sole intervention tool is discussed.
The purpose is to avoid conflicts between head-on replication and transcription.
Reversing the transcription bias slows down replication speed.
The researchers found ways to engineer inversions that did not affect other aspects of genome organization.
The reversed transcription bias leads to a lowered fitness of the inversion strains.
The inversion strains have a competitive disadvantage compared to wild-type cells in minimal medium.
The inversion of strongly-transcribed rRNA genes obstructs replication during growth in rich medium.
It confers a strong growth disadvantage, triggers DNA damage responses, causes some cell death, and leaves surviving cells more sensitive to genotoxic agents.
Evolution has favored this co-orientation mainly to avoid the detrimental effects described above.
The precise consequences of the conflict and its impact on genome organization are still not fully comprehended.
The reversed transcription bias decreased replication speed.

HIV-1 was found to be active within the cells of S. mansoni.
It opens up possibilities for investigating new therapies for schistosomiasis.
Leptospirosis is a disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., a type of bacteria.
Humans acquire leptospirosis primarily through contact with water sources contaminated with urine from infected animals.
Rats are asymptomatic carriers of leptospirosis.
Rats are critical for the transmission of leptospirosis to humans in urban slum environments because they carry the infection and can contaminate water sources with their urine.
Leptospira isolated from infected rats showed acetylation or tri-methylation of the highly abundant leptospiral lipoprotein LipL32.
No, Leptospira grown in culture did not result in any LipL32 lysine modifications.
The modifications in LipL32 may alter protein recognition by the immune response.
The synthetic peptide with a tri-methylated lysine modification exhibited less reactivity with serum from leptospirosis patients compared to the unmodified version, suggesting altered recognition by the immune response.
This study reports the first-time modification of a Leptospira protein during infection and suggests that these modifications may have functional consequences contributing to bacterial persistence during infection.
The main focus of the text is to explain the increasing global health threat of leptospirosis and highlight the role of rat carriers, the modifications observed in the LipL32 protein, and the potential implications for the immune response and bacterial persistence.
The purpose of effector memory CD8 T cell responses is to contribute to pathogen protection and control.
Novel CD8 T cell vaccine vectors employ the strategy of eliciting large antigen-specific long-lived effector memory CD8 T cell responses.
It is still unclear how pre-existing effector memory pools affect the development of new CD8 T cell responses against unrelated infections.
Mouse models were utilized to investigate the impact of sequential infections on CD8 T cell responses.
Acute MCMV infection appears to rapidly deplete existing memory populations via a Fas-dependent pathway.
No, immunizations with human adenovirus subtype 5-based vectors do not appear to detrimentally affect the host's pre-existing effector memory pool.
The Fas-dependent pathway plays a role in rapidly depleting existing memory populations during certain infections.
The host is able to accommodate and accumulate multiple new specificities of inflating effector memory populations at different times.
Many natural pathogens have the ability to elicit such responses.
CD8 T cell responses play a significant role in providing protection against pathogens and controlling their spread.
Examples include the exaggerated antlers of deer, the enormous clawed chelae of crabs, and the horns and mandibles of beetles.
Recent research has uncovered the importance of the sex-determination pathway in the expression of sexually dimorphic traits.
The main focus of this study is examining the developmental link between nutrition-sensitivity and sexual differentiation in the giant mandibles of the stag beetle.
The doublesex (dsx) gene is examined in relation to sexual differentiation in this study.
Juvenile hormone (JH) is an important insect hormone known to regulate insect polyphenisms, including the disproportionate growth of male stag beetle mandibles.
Cmdsx changes mandibular responsiveness to JH in a sex-specific pattern.
The hypothesis proposed is that sex-specific regulation of JH responsiveness serves as a developmental link between nutrition and sexual differentiation in stag beetles.
Sexual dimorphisms have fascinated biologists for centuries and are widespread across animal taxa.
The sexually dimorphic trait in stag beetles examined in this study is the giant mandibles.
The critical interactions between the sex-determination pathway and other growth regulatory mechanisms, such as the physiological mechanisms involved in nutrition-dependent expression of these traits, are less well understood.
Mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion are key features of β-cell dysfunction in T2D.
Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21.
Both T2D and DS display β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion in humans.
The screening method utilized different DS mouse models in combination with human gene expression data from T2D β-cells.
Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) was identified as the candidate gene.
Yes, high RCAN1 expression occurs in human and mouse T2D islets.
Increased RCAN1 expression in mice reduces β-cell mitochondrial function and ATP availability.
Reduced ATP availability due to increased RCAN1 expression negatively affects multiple ATP-dependent steps in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
β-cell dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion are key features of T2D.
The main focus of the study was to identify genes important in T2D through the trisomy 21 screening method, which involved DS mouse models and human gene expression data from T2D β-cells.
Rabies is a zoonotic disease caused by lyssaviruses.
More than 21,000 nucleotide sequences for rabies viruses have been deposited in public databases.
Affinity propagation (AP) clustering is a mathematical approach. It was used in this study to divide full genome RABV sequences into genetic clusters.
Affinity propagation clustering is considered a highly powerful tool because it can verifiably divide full genome RABV sequences into genetic clusters.
A panel of existing and novel RABV full genome sequences were used to demonstrate the application of AP for RABV clustering.
A combination of AP and established phylogenetic analyses is useful in resolving phylogenetic relationships between more objectively determined clusters and sequences.
The purpose of the workflow is to substantiate a transparent cluster distribution, not only for RABV, but also for other comparative sequence analyses.
The text does not mention specific applications of the affinity propagation clustering method beyond its use in dividing full genome RABV sequences.
Rabies is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans.
The use of affinity propagation clustering can help provide a more transparent cluster distribution, improving the accuracy and reliability of comparative sequence analyses.
The study focuses on analyzing the regulatory network involved in the terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes.
Oligodendrocytes are responsible for forming myelin in the vertebrate central nervous system, which ensures rapid saltatory conduction.
Myrf is directly activated by the transcription factor Sox10.
The Sox10-responsive enhancer is located in an evolutionarily conserved element in intron 1 of the Myrf gene.
Once induced, Myrf physically interacts and functionally cooperates with Sox10 to activate myelin genes.
The study defines an essential module in the myelin-specific regulatory network of the central nervous system.
The myelination in the two compartments of the vertebrate nervous system is regulated by similarly organized, but differentially implemented, regulatory networks.
The cells responsible for myelination in the peripheral nervous system are Schwann cells.
The regulatory module of Schwann cells consists of Sox10 and the Krox20 transcription factor.
Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells have similarly organized regulatory networks but implement them differently, resulting in differential regulation of myelination.
Dendritic tree structures are built to optimally collect inputs from other cells in the circuit.
Characteristic differences between cell types can be found based on how regularly the branch and termination points of dendrites are distributed.
Termination points of dendrites generally spread more randomly than the inputs they receive.
Branch points of dendrites closely follow the underlying input organization.
Computational models based on optimal wiring principles were used.
The characteristic differences in dendrite distribution affect the scaling properties of cell types.
The predictions were validated using existing connectome data.
The findings have importance for large scale neural circuit analysis.
The distribution of branch and termination points correlate little with other traditional branching statistics.
Computational models based on optimal wiring principles provide insights into the characteristics and behavior of dendritic tree structures.
One-third (1/3) of the world's population is affected by zinc deficiency.
Zinc deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection.
The main respiratory pathogen mentioned is Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Dietary zinc deficiency impacts host tissue zinc abundances by reducing the levels of zinc.
Zinc acts as a direct antimicrobial against bacterial pathogens and is mobilized by phagocytic cells as a part of the innate immune response.
No, immune activation is not affected by host zinc status according to the text.
The lack of antimicrobial zinc compromises bacterial control in zinc deficient hosts.
The findings highlight the importance of zinc sufficiency in resisting bacterial infection.
No, the molecular basis for how zinc deficiency compromises host control of infection remains to be understood.
Zinc is mobilized by phagocytic cells during infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The factors involved in the regulation of gene transcription include genetic factors, epigenetic factors, and trans-acting factors.
The chromatin environment at gene promoters, including nucleosome positioning and histone modifications, plays a key role in regulating gene expression by contributing to transcriptional activation and repression.
Antisense transcription is prevalent at gene promoters.
The function of antisense transcription is poorly understood.
The researchers characterized transcription in human breast cancer cells using next-generation sequencing techniques.
Extensive correlations were found between antisense transcription and the chromatin environment at promoters.
Downstream antisense transcription initiates from between regularly positioned nucleosomes.
The nucleosomes between sense and downstream antisense transcription start sites display histone modifications associated with active gene promoters.
Chromatin remodelers and other protein complexes responsible for creating and maintaining the promoter chromatin environment associate with the region where downstream antisense transcription initiates.
Antisense transcription is suggested to have an important role in the regulation of gene expression based on its association with the chromatin environment and the presence of regulatory protein complexes in the same region.
Dengue manifestations may vary from asymptomatic to potentially fatal complications.
With an increasing number of Dengue Hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and fatal cases, the availability of new approaches useful for cases confirmation plays an important role for disease surveillance.
Techniques such as viral RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, viral proteins detection by immunohistochemistry, and NS3 specific immunostaining can be used to diagnose fatal dengue cases in tissue specimens.
The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as a diagnostic technique to demonstrate DENV antigens in human tissue specimens, which has not been done previously in fatal dengue cases.
The highest sensitivity was obtained by a rapid ICT (immunochromatographic test), which was also the most sensitive in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus.
No, no research has been done previously to demonstrate NS1 presence in tissues of fatal dengue cases.
The application of NS1 kits to demonstrate the presence of DENV may provide a better understanding of viral tropism in fatal cases and may be useful for studies of pathogenesis in vivo and in experimental animals.
Previous studies focused on the usefulness of DENV NS1 antigen detection using different ELISAs in plasma and/or sera of dengue patients.
Dengue manifestations may vary from asymptomatic to potentially fatal complications.
Disease surveillance is important for dengue to track the increasing number of Dengue Hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and fatal cases, and to develop new approaches for cases confirmation.
HIV testing remains low among key populations, including MSM, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Few studies have formally evaluated crowdsourcing as a way to promote health in a real-world setting.
Previous studies suggested that crowdsourcing may be a promising approach to increase HIV testing among MSM in China.
Eight cities distributed in two provinces were involved in the investigation.
The intervention period showed an 8.9% absolute increase (and a 43% relative increase) in HIV testing compared to the control period.
The crowdsourced intervention was particularly effective in promoting HIV self-testing.
In this setting, crowdsourcing was found to be a way to develop innovative and effective HIV testing services.
Further research is needed to examine this approach in other settings.
A crowdsourcing approach can help build and sustain community engagement related to HIV testing.
Programs aiming to expand HIV testing should consider crowdsourcing as a tool to design tailored services.
The purpose is to evade detection and destruction by cytotoxic lymphocytes and persist within their hosts.
CD48 is a cell-surface molecule that acts as a ligand of the 2B4 receptor and regulates the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes.
A43, a CD48 homolog encoded by owl monkey CMV, has been investigated.
A43 exhibits exceptional binding kinetics for the 2B4 receptor.
A43 is capable of blocking the interaction between 2B4 and CD48.
A43 inhibits the immune synapse between human NK cells and target cells, thus interfering with their cytotoxicity.
These findings underscore the importance of 2B4-mediated immune responses in controlling CMV infections.
The shedding of a virally-encoded soluble variant of CD48 is unveiled as a new viral counteract mechanism.
Certain CMVs and other large DNA viruses encode homologs of CD48.
The CMV A43 is encoded by owl monkey CMV.
The main function of the myelin membrane is to act as an insulator and enable fast conduction of action potentials.
Oligodendrocytes are responsible for synthesizing myelin in the central nervous system.
Myelin is vulnerable to lipid metabolism disorders because it has a high lipid content.
Yes, extracellular lipids are involved in the process of myelination by oligodendrocytes.
Myelin membrane synthesis is reduced when lipid synthesis is inactivated in either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes.
Myelin membrane synthesis is virtually absent when lipid synthesis is inactivated in both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes.
Oligodendrocytes bypass the deficiency by using dietary lipids for myelin membrane synthesis.
Yes, a high-fat diet can promote myelin synthesis.
The conclusion is that extracellular lipids, provided by astrocytes or obtained through diet, contribute to myelination by oligodendrocytes during normal brain development.
It is currently unknown where the extracellular lipids involved in myelination originate from.
Proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids or peptides.
Cells create proteins by following the blueprints in the DNA and stringing together amino acids or peptides.
Freshly made proteins are typically long, structure-less chains of peptides, but shortly afterwards, most of them fold into characteristic structures.
The structure of a protein is important as it determines the functions the protein can perform within the cell.
The structure of a protein can be determined through X-ray diffraction and other experimental approaches, although they are labor-intensive and difficult.
The order of the peptides in a protein can be read directly from the DNA blueprint.
The approach used in this paper is to construct a probabilistic model for sequence variability and then use the parameters of that model to predict structure in three-dimensional space.
The main technical novelty of this paper is that it uses models more directly matched to the data compared to previous contributions in the same general direction.
X-ray diffraction and other experimental approaches can determine protein structure.
Proteins execute many functions in cells, and their structure is crucial in determining what they can do.
The mortality rate of Hantaan virus in Asia is approximately 15%.
Alternative vaccinations against Hantaan virus are a priority because there is currently no effective prevention available and the early symptoms of the disease are non-specific, leading to delays in seeking medical care or misdiagnosis.
The study defined five novel HTNV nucleoprotein CD8+ T-cell epitopes.
The HTNV nucleoprotein CD8+ T-cell epitopes were defined in the most popular HLA alleles in the Chinese Han population.
The study evaluated the correlations between the CD8+ T-cell response and the different outcomes of the severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
Effective HTNV nucleoprotein epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were characterized by interferon-γ secretion, strong capacity for activation, and proliferation.
Epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses play an important role in disease control after acute zoonotic Hantaan virus infections in humans.
The goal of peptide vaccine development is to speed up the process of developing a vaccine against Hantaan virus.
Hantaan virus primarily affects rodents but can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans.
No, there is currently no effective prevention method available for Hantaan virus.
This work was conducted in coastal Guinea.
Coastal Guinea is the last focus in Western Africa where the transmission of Human African Trypanosomiasis is still very active.
The goals of the Guinean government and its partners are to reduce the burden of Human African Trypanosomiasis and to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020, in accordance with WHO's objectives.
The control efforts for HAT were deeply impaired during the Ebola outbreak.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the Ebola outbreak on HAT screening and caring activities.
Active screening activities were interrupted during the Ebola outbreak.
Passive surveillance and diagnosis were severely affected due to the fear of the population to visit the endemic district for confirmation and treatment, as well as the banning of using rapid tests in peripheral health structures and the requisition of healthcare workers and facilities for Ebola response.
Only 59 HAT patients were diagnosed and treated during the Ebola outbreak.
The potentially high number of undiagnosed human reservoir of trypanosomes may have contributed to an increase in transmission levels.
A rapid revival of HAT control activities in Guinea is vital in order to stay in line with the 2020 elimination goal and to prevent possible bursts of the disease.
The main symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, aberrant behavior, lack of emotional expression, diminished motivation, and social withdrawal.

Yes, the researchers analyzed the DNA separately for men and women.
Yes, the researchers identified a genetic variant that increases the risk of developing schizophrenia in women only.
The identified genetic variant is estimated to increase the risk of schizophrenia for women carrying the risk variant by 1.4-fold.
The identified genetic variant is in a gene called reelin.
Yes, the reelin gene is known to play a part in brain development.
No, it is still unclear how this genetic variant predisposes to schizophrenia or why it is specific to women only.

To understand the formation of multiple effector cells from progenitor cells.
It is controlled by the action of several molecules, cytokines, antigen recognition, and direct contact with T helper cells.
No, there is currently no general consensus regarding the structure and dynamical behavior of the regulatory network.
It is not well understood how the network controls the establishment of specific B cell expression patterns and how it responds to specific external signals.
The model describes the dynamical behavior of the regulatory network controlling terminal B cell differentiation under normal and mutant conditions.
The model recovers the patterns of differentiation of B cells.
The model can generate qualitative descriptions to interpret the role of intra- and extracellular regulators of B cell differentiation.
The text mentions that there is a large body of experimental data regarding some of the key molecules involved, but does not specify them.
The process is controlled by several factors, including cytokines, antigen recognition, and direct contact with T helper cells.
Studying gain- and loss-of-function mutants allows for a better understanding of how specific genetic alterations affect the differentiation process.
The main focus of the study is the analysis of DNA methylation patterns in intestinal adenoma, serving as a model for early stages of tumor development.
MeDIP-seq (Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing) was used to analyze the DNA methylome of APCMin adenoma.
The list of recurring DMRs provides insights into the epigenetic changes specific to intestinal adenoma, potentially identifying genes involved in tumor initiation.
Hypermethylated DMRs are strongly enriched with Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) targets.
Several PRC2 components and DNA methyltransferases were found to be up-regulated in adenoma, suggesting their involvement in the development of intestinal adenoma.
The DNA methylation signature observed in adenoma cells is shown to arise de novo rather than being an expansion of a pre-existing pattern in intestinal stem cells or undifferentiated crypt cells.
The text states that epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors, a common occurrence in colon cancer, is rare in adenoma.
The core set of DMRs, conserved between mouse adenoma and human colon cancer, may represent a global panel of epigenetically modified genes specific to intestinal tumors.
The research allows for the distinction between early conserved epigenetic alterations occurring in intestinal adenoma and late stochastic events that promote colon cancer progression.
The findings may facilitate the selection of more specific clinical epigenetic biomarkers for intestinal tumors, helping in early detection and treatment decisions.
TcI to TcVI.
TcI is found in patients from northern Latin America, while TcII is found in patients from southern Latin America.
The hypothesis is that Y strain and Col cl1.7 cause distinct immunological changes in human peripheral blood cells, which might influence the clinical course of Chagas disease.
The infectivity of CFSE-stained trypomastigotes of Col cl1.7 and Y strain in human monocytes was evaluated for 15 and 72 hours.
The immunological profile of lymphocytes and monocytes exposed to the different isolates was determined using multiparameter flow cytometry.
Yes, the results showed a similar percentage and intensity of monocyte infection by both Y strain and Col cl1.7.
Monocytes infected with Col cl1.7 showed increased expression of CD80 and CD86, while monocytes infected with Y strain did not show increased expression of these markers.
Monocytes infected with Col cl1.7 showed significantly higher levels of IL-10 compared to monocytes infected with Y strain.
Infection with Col cl1.7 led to an increased expression of IL-17 by CD8+ T cells. There is no information provided about the effect of Y strain on IL-17 expression.
A positive correlation between the expression of TNF-alpha and granzyme A was observed only after infection with Y strain.
pol ν is involved in meiotic homologous recombination in processing specific substrates.
POLN gene encodes pol ν.
The highest relative expression of POLN is in the testis.
There were no anatomic abnormalities, alterations in lifespan, or changed causes of mortality.
Yes, mice with inactive Poln are fertile and have normal testis morphology.
pol ν-disrupted mice have a modestly reduced crossover frequency at a specific meiotic recombination hot spot with insertion/deletion polymorphisms.
Poln-defective mice do not show alterations in DNA end-joining during immunoglobulin class-switching.
There are no alterations in DNA end-joining in polν-defective mice, but animals with pol θ defects show changes.
Inactivation of Poln in mouse embryonic fibroblasts does not alter cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C, cisplatin, or aldehydes.
Depletion of POLN from human cells with shRNA or siRNA does not change cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C or alter the frequency of mitomycin C-induced radial chromosomes.
The different diseases caused by the dengue virus are self-limiting dengue fever, severe life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome.
The existence of four serotypes of the dengue virus has complicated the development of an effective and safe dengue vaccine.
Sanofi Pasteur's CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine did not confer full protection against dengue-2 virus.
The immunogen used in the new generation of vaccines is the dengue-2 envelope protein domain III (D2ED III).
The immunogen (D2ED III) was expressed in lipidated form in Escherichia coli during the study.
The formulation containing lipidated D2ED III elicited higher D2ED III-specific antibody responses compared to the nonlipidated counterpart, D2ED III, and dengue-2 virus.
The antibodies induced by LD2ED III had higher avidity and neutralizing capacity compared to those induced by D2ED III and dengue-2 virus.
Lipidation of the subunit candidate LD2ED III reduced the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in mice.
The lipidated subunit vaccine approach could potentially be applied to other serotypes of the dengue virus and other pathogens.
The study suggests that the lipidated subunit vaccine approach represents a promising method of dengue vaccine development and may complement the deficiencies of the CYD tetravalent dengue vaccine.
The study focuses on analyzing how fluctuations in signaling protein concentrations lead to cell-to-cell variability in protein kinase signaling.
"Pathway sensitivity" refers to the stimulus level at which a signaling pathway responds.
Minimal kinase cascades with gradual dose-response behavior show variability because the pathway sensitivity and the maximal activation level cannot remain constant simultaneously.
Negative feedback regulation resolves the trade-off by reducing fluctuations in both the pathway sensitivity and the maximal activation level.
Feedbacks acting at different levels in the signaling cascade control different aspects of the dose-response curve, which synergistically reduces the variability.
Yes, ultrasensitive signaling cascades can be inherently robust to protein concentration fluctuations.
The cell-to-cell variability of ultrasensitive signaling systems can be actively regulated by altering the expression of phosphatase(s) or introducing feedback/feedforward loops.
Slow transcriptional negative feedback loops allow for variability suppression while still maintaining switch-like decision making in signaling cascades.
The design principles involve incorporating negative feedback regulation and utilizing ultrasensitive signaling cascades, both of which reduce variability and enhance robustness.
Yes, the results of the study may explain why certain signaling cascades, such as the yeast pheromone pathway, exhibit switch-like decision making with little cell-to-cell variability.
The objective is to understand CD8+ T cell responses in the context of chronic inflammation and antigen persistence in VL.
Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in VL have not been studied because there were no defined Leishmania-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes.
The researchers used transgenic Leishmania donovani parasites that expressed ovalbumin to characterize the development, function, and fate of Leishmania-specific CD8+ T cell responses.
The study found that L. donovani parasites evade CD8+ T cell responses by limiting their expansion and inducing functional exhaustion and cell death.
Dysfunctional CD8+ T cells were partially rescued by in vivo B7-H1 blockade, which increased their survival but did not restore cytokine production.
B7-H1 blockade significantly reduced the splenic parasite burden.
The findings could be exploited for the design of new strategies for immunotherapeutic interventions against VL.
The common feature is chronic infection in the spleen.
CD8+ T cells are required for the development of protective immunity.
Ovalbumin was expressed by transgenic Leishmania donovani parasites and used as a tool to study Leishmania-specific CD8+ T cell responses.
The prion protein exhibits a dual behavior with two possible transition routes.
The conditions that mimic those encountered in endosomes include protonation of H187 around pH 4.5.
The protonated imidazole ring of H187 experiences an electrostatic repulsion with the nearby guanidinium group of R136.
The system responds by pushing either H187 or R136 sidechains away from their native cavities.
The regions linked to H187 (C-terminal part of H2) and R136 (loop connecting S1 to H1) are affected in a different manner depending on the pathway.
Specific in vivo or in vitro conditions, such as the presence of molecular chaperones or a particular experimental setup, may favor one transition pathway over the other.
The different transition pathways can result in different monomers, potentially leading to the observation of various fibril morphologies and the outcome of prion strains.
The absence of the residue pair in non-mammalian species that are known to be resistant to prion diseases supports the finding.
Molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the prion protein's behavior.
The protonation of H187 is observed around pH 4.5.
The purpose is to reduce the risk of vision loss.
Epilation, which involves repeated plucking of lashes touching the eye.
The long-term impact is unknown.
1300 individuals were recruited.

Macrophages (MØ) and mononuclear phagocytes.
The discovery that the MØ mannose receptor (MR) binds to all four serotypes of DV and specifically to the envelope glycoprotein is mentioned for the first time.
MR binds to DV via its carbohydrate recognition domains.
Glycan analysis, ELISA, and blot overlay assays.
Deglycosylation of the DV envelope glycoprotein.
NIH3T3 cells express recombinant MR.
DV infection of primary human MØ can be blocked by anti-MR antibodies.
MØ pre-treated with type 2 cytokines (IL-4 or IL-13) enhance their susceptibility to productive DV infection.
MR is a prototypic marker of alternatively activated MØ.
The findings indicate a new functional role for the MR in DV infection.
The purpose is to study and understand the interactions between neural dynamics and the environment.
The simple model controls an agent moving in a virtual environment.
The dynamics rapidly destabilize both neural and behavioral dynamics.
Homeostatic plasticity plays a role in balancing neural activity by adjusting local inhibition and compensating for sensory input in other regions.
Local inhibition adjusts to balance excitatory input.
Regional "task-negative" activity compensates for "task positive" sensory input in another region.
Homeostatic mechanisms lead to more stable behavior and trajectories through the environment.
Local mechanisms maintain neural activity balance, while macroscale mechanisms maintain behavioral dynamics.
The text suggests a novel functional role for such patterns, specifically mentioning the default mode network.
Computational simulations investigate brain-environment feedback interactions.
Recent measurements have revealed numerous intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions in various eukaryotic cells.
It is not clear to what extent these interactions regulate gene expression.
The question is intriguing in budding yeast because it has extensive long-distance chromosomal interactions but few cases of gene regulation over a distance.
A medium-throughput assay was developed to screen for functional long-distance interactions in yeast.
An insulated MET3 promoter (MET3pr) flanked by ~1kb invariable sequences was ectopically inserted into thousands of genomic loci.
The average expression level and cell-to-cell variability (noise) of the reporter gene were measured in single cells.
The three distinct patterns of MET3pr expression included low expression / high noise, low expression / low noise, and high expression / low noise.
The three mechanisms identified were Sir2-mediated silencing, transcriptional interference, and 3D clustering.
Clustering also occurs in the native genome and enhances the transcription of endogenous Met4-targeted genes.
The results demonstrated that a small fraction of long-distance chromosomal interactions can affect gene expression in yeast.
The role of crossovers/chiasmata in the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I is to ensure appropriate positional segregation.
Crossover assurance helps in the segregation process by ensuring at least one crossover occurs per homolog pair.
Interference reduces double crossovers and helps control the distribution of crossovers during segregation.
The study investigated the relationship between chromosome axis morphogenesis and non-random crossover placement.
Chromosome axes are structurally modified at future crossover sites, as indicated by the association of crossover designation marker Zip3 and axis ensemble Hop1/Red1.
The association between crossover designation marker Zip3 and axis ensemble Hop1/Red1 is first detected at the zygotene stage.
The conserved AAA+ ATPase Pch2 controls the association between crossover designation marker Zip3 and axis ensemble Hop1/Red1.
Pch2 mediates crossover interference, controlling the distribution of crossovers during meiosis.
Pch2 is not essential for crossover formation at normal levels.
Pch2 is also involved in chiasma formation and has further functions in viable spore formation.
Pathogen perception by the plant innate immune system is important for plant survival and productivity.
The Arabidopsis protein RIN4 is a negative regulator of plant immunity.
The objective of the study was to identify additional proteins involved in RIN4-mediated immune signal transduction.
The researchers purified components of the RIN4 protein complex to identify new proteins involved in RIN4 signaling.
RIN4 interacts with AHA1 and AHA2, which are plasma membrane H+-ATPases.
PM H+-ATPase activation induces stomatal opening, while inactivation induces stomatal closure.
The knockout line of RIN4 exhibited reduced PM H+-ATPase activity compared to the overexpression line.
RIN4 functions with the PM H+-ATPase to regulate stomatal apertures.
The stomata of the rin4 knockout line could not be re-opened by virulent Pseudomonas syringae.
RIN4 is expressed in guard cells.
Chikungunya and dengue.
They are initially introduced by infectious travelers from tropical endemic areas.
They are spread locally through mosquito bites.
Interventions targeted to control vector abundance, such as routine larviciding.
Aedes albopictus populations.
Entomological surveillance data collected from ten municipalities in Northern Italy during 2014 and 2015.
Routine larviciding can limit both the risk of autochthonous transmission and the size of potential epidemics.
The ideal timing for larvicide interventions is during the month of July.
Locally transmitted chikungunya cases can be reduced by 20% - 33% with a single application of larviciding.
In larger municipalities, the cost of comprehensive larviciding overcomes potential health benefits, suggesting the adoption of more localized interventions.
The subtasks involved in bat echolocation include navigation, prey detection, and object recognition.
The approach used to understand the echolocation capabilities of bats is isolating the minimal set of acoustic cues needed to complete each task.
No, the minimal cues supporting obstacle avoidance in echolocating bats have not been identified yet.
The Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) and travel time of the first millisecond of the echo train are proposed as the minimal cues for obstacle avoidance.
No, a reconstruction of the 3D layout of the scene is not necessary for obstacle avoidance in bats.
The constant frequency bat Rhinolophus rouxii is used as a model for the control algorithm.
Yes, simple phonotaxis can steer a bat clear from obstacles without the need for reconstructing the 3D layout of the scene.
No, the proposed cues can be exploited by both constant frequency (CF) bats and frequency modulated (FM) bats.
Using a low level yet robust cue for obstacle avoidance allows bats to comply with the hard real-time constraints of this basic behavior.
No, this paper presents the first computationally explicit explanation for obstacle avoidance validated in complex simulated environments.
Metabolic networks perform energy transduction and building block biosynthesis functions.
It is intimately related to the enigma of life's origin and the evolution of metabolism might be subject to general principles.
They can be used to exhaustively search for artificial chemistry pathways that can optimally perform elementary metabolic functions.
The pathways displayed properties such as autocatalytic cycles, hierarchical modules, universally preferable metabolites and reactions, and a logarithmic trend of pathway length as a function of input/output molecule size.
Methods previously used in cryptography were borrowed to derive some of the analytically predicted properties.
Biochemical networks were mapped onto a simplified carbon atom reaction backbone.
The properties predicted for the artificial chemistry also hold for real metabolic networks, suggesting that optimality principles and arithmetic simplicity might underlie some biochemical complexity.
One of the most fascinating open questions is understanding the evolutionary history and complex wiring of metabolic networks.
The pathways displayed autocatalytic cycles, hierarchical modules, universally preferable metabolites and reactions, and a logarithmic trend of pathway length.
Understanding the evolution of metabolism, which is performed by metabolic networks, is intimately related to the enigma of life's origin.
Genetic diversity plays a fundamental role in species by influencing the level of genetic similarity across populations and how it changes with geographic distance.
Genetic similarity can vary in complex ways across different geographical areas and time periods.
Molecular ecology, conservation genetics, evolutionary genetics, and human genetics are some of the fields that commonly use methods to study and visualize genetic relationships.
Inferring migration rate maps is a promising approach to understanding how migration rates vary across geographic space and time.
Maps of population sizes and migration rates associated with different time periods can be estimated using a method that counts the number of long haplotype sharing segments.
"Identity-by-descent tracts" refers to long segments of haplotype sharing that indicate genetic similarity between individuals.
The proposed method can reveal time-varying migration rates and population sizes, including changes that are not detectable when ignoring haplotypic structure.
The methods were applied to a contemporary European dataset called POPRES.
The analysis covered the last approximately 3,000 years of population structure and growth in Europe.
While not explicitly stated in the text, other factors such as natural selection, genetic drift, and environmental conditions can also influence population histories.
Defective insulin signaling is associated with ageing.
Insulin resistance in the liver leads to chronic damage and fibrosis.
It is unclear how tissue-repair mechanisms integrate insulin signals and how they are affected by insulin resistance in the liver.
Insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) plays a significant role in promoting fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) signaling during chronic injury.
Insulin resistance impairs local cellular crosstalk between the fibrotic stroma and liver progenitor cells (LPCs).
Insulin resistance dramatically impairs proregenerative fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) signaling.
Insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) promotes the expression of FGFR2-IIIb.
IRS2 is proposed as a positive regulator of communication between cell types during the transition between stromal to epithelial repair.
Silencing of IRS2 shifts the equilibrium away from paracrine epithelial repair towards fibrogenesis.
This study provides a compelling insight into the contribution of insulin resistance to the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease.
Neurons' dendrites receive excitatory or sensory inputs.
The regulation of dendrite arbor formation is only partially understood.
A mutation in the ER stress sensor IRE-1/Ire1 was identified as crucial.
Yes, the role of IRE-1/Ire1 in dendrite patterning is evolutionarily conserved.
No, mutations in other ER stress sensors do not affect PVD dendrites in the same way.
IRE-1's nuclease activity is necessary for its role in dendrite morphogenesis.
No, mutations in xbp-1 do not cause PVD phenotypes.
The secretion and distal localization to dendrites of the DMA-1/leucine rich transmembrane receptor is defective in ire-1 mutants.
Yes, reducing Insulin/IGF1 signaling can bypass the secretory block in ire-1 mutants.
Reducing Insulin/IGF signaling and improving ER homeostasis and function.
The main focus of the study is to understand how cells control redox balance globally at the level of gene expression.
The response regulator studied is ArcA.
ArcA reprograms metabolism under anaerobic conditions, repressing carbon oxidation pathways that recycle redox carriers via respiration.
ArcA favors catabolic pathways that recycle redox carriers via fermentation.
The analysis revealed that most ArcA binding sites contain additional direct repeat elements beyond the two required for binding an ArcA dimer.
The DNA site occupancy is concentration-sensitive and dictated by non-canonical arrangements of cis-regulatory modules.
Other transcription factors such as σ70-RNAP may also use the same narrow sequence space for binding.
The proposed advantage is that it allows efficient binding sites encoding for ArcA and other transcription factors and helps in global control of carbon metabolism to maintain redox homeostasis.
Maintaining redox homeostasis is crucial for cellular viability.
ArcA responds to the quinone/quinol redox couple via its membrane-bound sensor kinase, ArcB.
The loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor function is associated with human malignancies.
The molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for tumorigenic Rb downregulation are not fully defined.
A forward genetic screen and positional cloning were used to identify the mutation.
The mutated gene is called ubiquitin specific peptidase 39 (usp39), which encodes a component of RNA splicing machinery.
Zebrafish usp39 mutants exhibited microcephaly and adenohypophyseal cell lineage expansion without apparent changes in major hypothalamic hormonal and regulatory signals.
Gene expression profiling of usp39 mutants revealed decreased rb1 and increased e2f4, rbl2 (p130), and cdkn1a (p21) expression.
Overexpression of Rb1 mRNA partially reversed embryonic pituitary expansion in usp39 mutants.
Misspliced Rb1 pre-mRNA in usp39 mutants results in a premature stop codon.
Usp39 regulates embryonic pituitary homeostasis by targeting rb1 and e2f4 expression.
Dysregulated rb1 and e2f4 pathways may result in pituitary tumorigenesis.
Infection of the developing fetus with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the major cause of central nervous system disease.
The mechanism(s) of disease associated with this intrauterine infection remain poorly understood.
Peripheral inoculation of newborn mice with MCMV results in CNS infection and developmental abnormalities that recapitulate key features of the human infection.
Animals in the mouse model exhibit decreased granule neuron precursor cell (GNPC) proliferation and altered morphogenesis of the cerebellar cortex.
The deficits in cerebellar cortical development are symmetric and global.
The encephalitis resulting from CNS infection is non-necrotizing and characterized by widely scattered foci of virus-infected cells with mononuclear cell infiltrates.
The findings suggested that inflammation induced by MCMV infection could underlie deficits in CNS development.
The researchers modulated inflammatory responses in infected mice with glucocorticoids to investigate their contribution to abnormal cerebellar development.
Glucocorticoid treatment decreased activation of CNS mononuclear cells and expression of inflammatory cytokines, while minimally impacting CNS virus replication.
Glucocorticoid treatment limited morphogenic abnormalities and normalized the expression of developmentally regulated genes within the cerebellum.
ETEC is a major diarrheal pathogen in developing countries and causes millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths annually.
Pathogenic Escherichia coli, including ETEC, use the autotransporter (AT) secretion mechanism to export virulence factors.
Autotransporter proteins consist of a highly conserved carboxy terminal outer membrane beta barrel and a surface-exposed amino terminal passenger domain.
Recent immunoproteomic studies suggesting that multiple autotransporter passenger domains are recognized during ETEC infection prompted the present studies.
Available ETEC genomes were examined to identify autotransporter coding sequences present in pathogenic isolates but not in the commensal E. coli HS strain.
Recombinant passenger domains derived from autotransporters Ag43 and pAT were recognized by antibodies from mice following intestinal challenge with ETEC.
Ag43 and pAT were identified on the surface of ETEC using flow cytometry.
Convalescent sera from patients with ETEC diarrhea recognized Ag43 and pAT.
Vaccination of mice with recombinant passenger domains from pAT or Ag43 provided protection against intestinal colonization with ETEC.
Passenger domains of conserved autotransporter proteins could contribute to protective immune responses and represent potential targets for vaccine development in ETEC infections.
The first case of CCHF in Oman was detected in 1995.
The diagnosis of CCHF in Oman was confirmed by serology and/or molecular tests.
Public Health England studied the RNA from recent CCHF cases.
A total of 88 cases of CCHF were reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Oman between 1995 and 2017.
There were 4 sporadic cases in 1995 and 1996, followed by no cases until 2011. From 2011 to 2017, the incidence steadily increased.
Contact with animals and/or butchering was the major risk factor for CCHF infection in Oman.
23.8% of the reported cases clustered around Eid Al Adha.
The median age of the CCHF patients reported in Oman was 33 years.
Among severe CCHF cases, a platelet count < 50 x 109/L was observed in 72.7% of cases.
No, there was no evidence of intrafamilial spread or healthcare-associated infection for CCHF in Oman.
The term used is robustness.
Examples include protein activities and gene expression levels.
The cell cycle becomes fragile when CDC14 is overexpressed.
The cell cycle remains robust when ESP1 is overexpressed.
They are regulated by 1:1 binding with their inhibitors, Net1 and Pds1, respectively.
The model predicts extreme fragility of the cell cycle caused by dosage imbalance between these genes.
No, it has not been experimentally shown yet.
They performed combinatorial "genetic tug-of-war" experiments.
They found that dosage imbalance between CDC14 and NET1 causes fragility.
It is masked by CDH1 and CLB2, with the masking function of CLB2 being the stabilization of Pds1 by its phosphorylation.
The role of STAT6 in herpesvirus lytic replication remains elusive.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is used as a model in this study.
RTA acts as the master regulator of lytic replication in herpesvirus.
RTA interacts with STAT6 and promotes its degradation via the proteasome and lysosome systems.
The degradation of STAT6 involves lysine 48 (K48) and K63-linked ubiquitylation.
STAT6 degradation is associated with increased ubiquitylated form of TRIML2, promoting prolonged cell survival and virion production.
Lytic activation of Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and cytomegalovirus also commonly exhibit degradation of STAT6.
The degradation of STAT6 may serve as an attractive therapeutic target for the lytic activation of KSHV.
Aberrations in STAT6-mediated signaling are linked to the development of multiple cancer types.
Increasing evidence has shown that activation of human oncogenic herpesvirus lytic replication is crucial for viral tumorigenesis.
The greatest burden of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases was observed in 2000.
The main objectives of the study were to determine the magnitude of seroprevalence and seroconversion among the surveyed population, and establish the individual/household level risk factors for the presence of DENV antibodies.
Study participants were recruited from 12 out of 90 wards in Dhaka.
The seroprevalence among all pre-monsoon samples in 2012 was 80.0% (900 out of 1125).
Out of the 97 paired samples that were negative at the pre-monsoon time point, 56 were positive at the post-monsoon time point.
Age, possession of indoor potted plants, and types of mosquito control measures were significant factors associated with DENV seroprevalence.
The serological analysis revealed that a large proportion of the population in Dhaka were newly exposed to DENV during the study period, but the exact percentage is not mentioned.
The high level of seroconversion suggests that there was an intense circulation of DENV in Dhaka in 2012.
Home-based interventions, such as removing indoor potted plants and increased bed net use, in addition to vector control measures in public parks, could reduce exposure to DENV and decrease the risk of viral associated disease.
The study revealed that DENV strains were the only flaviviruses circulating in Dhaka in 2012.
The strict anaerobe Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea.
The oxygen-resistant spores that Clostridium difficile forms have a central role in the infectious cycle.
The late stages of sporulation in Clostridium difficile require the mother cell regulatory protein σK.
In Bacillus subtilis, the onset of σK activity requires both excision of a prophage-like element inserted in the sigK gene and proteolytical removal of an inhibitory pro-sequence.
The skinBs recombinase is produced specifically in the mother cell of Bacillus subtilis.
No, σK in C. difficile lacks a pro-sequence.
CD1231 is necessary for sporulation and skinCd excision in C. difficile.
The expression of CD1231 is observed in vegetative cells and in both sporangial compartments of C. difficile.
σE and SpoIIID are the mother cell regulatory proteins that control the skinCd excision in C. difficile.
CD1234, controlled by σE and SpoIIID, is required for sporulation and skinCd excision in C. difficile.
The purpose is to provide a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions.
The challenges include a lack of validated computational tools for learning tasks and questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across different cohorts.
The study develops a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers.
The meta-analysis included a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples.
Feature selection and the use of strain-specific markers generally improved disease-prediction capabilities in the study.
In some cases, models transferred between studies were less accurate than models tested within-study cross-validation.
The addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities.
Streptococcus anginosus is mentioned as a microbial species that characterizes general dysbiotic states of the microbiome.
The results can be considered as a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis.
They are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.
HLA-B*5701.
Yes, the risk of progression may vary among patients carrying this allele.
The study used longitudinal viral sequences from high-risk progressors (HRPs) and low-risk progressors (LRPs) and estimated the absolute rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions using Bayesian relaxed molecular clock methodology.
Yes, the HIV-1 synonymous substitution rates were significantly lower in LRPs compared to HRPs, particularly for sets of internal branches.
No, the differences in viral evolution rates did not correlate with viral fitness, as measured by in vitro replication capacity.
Yes, a significant inverse correlation was found between baseline CD4+ T cell counts and the mean HIV-1 synonymous rate along branches representing viral lineages successfully propagating through time.
The study suggests that the observed lower replication rate in HLA-B*5701 subjects with higher baseline CD4+ T cell counts provides a potential model to explain differences in risk of disease progression.
The study utilized a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock methodology to estimate the absolute rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions.
Yes, the viral population infecting LRPs was characterized by a slower increase in synonymous divergence over time.
No, the study found that the observed differences in viral evolution rates could not be explained by differences in T cell activation or selection pressure among the study subjects.
Elucidating the mechanism of action of trypanocidal compounds is important in developing more effective drugs against Trypanosoma brucei.
A screening approach using an RNAi library in T. brucei bloodstream forms was used to identify TbMCP14 as a prime candidate.
Depletion of TbMCP14 by RNAi in both bloodstream and procyclic forms increased resistance of parasites towards the compounds by 7-fold and 3-fold, respectively.
Down-regulation of TbMCP14 protected bloodstream form mitochondria from a drug-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.
Over-expression of the carrier in procyclic forms increased parasite susceptibility by more than 13-fold.
The proline metabolite, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, showed increased levels in parasites over-expressing TbMCP14.
No, TbMCP14 is not essential for survival of T. brucei bloodstream forms.
Depletion of TbMCP14 in procyclic forms resulted in growth arrest, followed by parasite death.
The major energy source (glucose versus proline) in the culture medium determines the time point at which parasite proliferation stops in TbMCP14-depleted procyclic forms.
TbMCP14 belongs to a trypanosomatid-specific clade of mitochondrial carrier family proteins and shows very poor similarity to mitochondrial carriers of mammals, making it a potentially unique target for drug action or targeting.
GPCRs play an important role in physiology and disease.
Orphan GPCRs are considered potential drug targets.
The contrary view suggests that there might be a fraction of orphan GPCRs that function ligand-independently.
Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) is a potential orphan GPCR.
The original ligands are neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP).
The altered key residues are Q127R, P205S, and R294H.
Placental mammalian BRS3 has lost the binding affinity to NMB/GRP.
The N terminus plays an important role in the constitutive activity of placental mammalian BRS3.
Yes, BRS3 is constitutively active in placental mammals.
This study identified the first example of a genuinely orphan GPCR and proposed new perspectives in GPCR deorphanization.
Understanding sleep and its perturbation by environment, mutation, or medication remains a central problem in biomedical research.
Brain state analysis via classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures is used to examine sleep in animal models.
The traditional method is visual inspection of raw EEG recordings by trained human experts. It is laborious and prone to inter-individual variability.
Machine learning approaches often have insufficient generalization capabilities, especially across animals from different experimental studies.
The researchers developed a convolutional neural network-based architecture to produce domain invariant predictions and integrated a hidden Markov model to constrain state dynamics based on known sleep physiology.
SPINDLE was validated using data of four animal cohorts from three independent sleep labs and achieved average agreement rates of 99%, 98%, 93%, and 97% with scorings from five human experts from different labs.
The SPINDLE method generalized across different genetic mutants, surgery procedures, recording setups, and even different species, surpassing state-of-the-art solutions in these aspects.
The scored data processed by SPINDLE can be used for downstream analyzes identical to those from human-scored data, including the ability to detect mutation-induced sleep alteration.
The scientific community can access and utilize the SPINDLE method and benchmarking datasets through the online server at https://sleeplearning.ethz.ch.
The aim of the researchers is to catalyze high-throughput and well-standardized experimental studies to improve our understanding of sleep.
Their aim is to ensure a steady supply of energy and anabolic building blocks for rapid growth.
The obligate intracellular parasite used is Toxoplasma gondii.
Apicomplexa parasites synthesize isoprenoid precursors in the apicoplast.
TgFPPS is responsible for synthesizing longer isoprenoids from the precursors in T. gondii.
The null mutants have only a mild growth phenotype, similar to wild type parasites.
The loss becomes phenotypically apparent when the parasites are in the extracellular environment.
It suggests that the intracellular parasite salvages FPP and/or GGPP from the host.
Mammals use the mevalonate pathway, which is susceptible to statins.
Atorvastatin (Lipitor) has been successful in curing the mice.
The proposed approach is a double-hit strategy combining inhibitors of host and parasite pathways to combat Apicomplexan parasites.
The Sigatoka disease complex is caused by the closely-related fungi Pseudocercospora musae, Pseudocercospora eumusae, and Pseudocercospora fijiensis.
Pseudocercospora eumusae and Pseudocercospora fijiensis are considered the most aggressive species among the three.
The purpose is to understand the genomic modifications associated with shifts in species virulence and to identify their pathogenic core that can be used in disease management programs.
P. eumusae and P. fijiensis show complementary patterns of expansions and contractions in core gene families related to metabolism and enzymatic degradation of plant cell walls.
No, phylogenetic reconstruction supports an earlier evolutionary radiation of P. fijiensis from P. musae and P. eumusae.
Different rates of LTR retrotransposon proliferation contribute to differences in genome size.
The three species have fairly dissimilar repertoires of effector proteins, suggesting that they likely evolved different strategies for manipulating the host immune system.
234 gene families, including seven putative effectors, are exclusively present in the three Sigatoka species.
The Sigatoka disease complex, caused by the three closely-related fungi, is currently the most devastating disease on bananas worldwide.
P. eumusae and P. fijiensis are considered the most aggressive, while P. musae is less virulent. This indicates clear differences in virulence among the three species.
Illumina Bead Chip microarray technology.
VL patients.
Pathways and gene modules related to myeloid cells.
VL patients had a lower proportion of monocytes and neutrophils.
Heterogeneous transcriptional profiles associated with activation of T lymphocytes, type I interferon signaling, and cell cycle.
Activation of the Notch signaling pathway.
Similar gene expression profiles, but asymptomatic individuals exhibited particularities related to lymphocyte activation and a type I interferon response.
They validated a set of target genes by RT-qPCR.
This study provides insights into the molecular pathways that contribute to the progression of visceral leishmaniasis and the transcriptional activity associated with protective mechanisms.
Visceral leishmaniasis can be lethal if left untreated.
The central paradox is that natural selection should favor exploitative individuals who avoid paying their fair share of costs.
Conflict between cooperating individuals often leads to the evolution of complex, opponent-specific social strategies and counterstrategies.
The genetic and biological mechanisms underlying complex social strategies, and therefore the evolution of cooperative behavior, are largely unknown.
The researchers have combined mathematical modeling, molecular genetic, and developmental approaches to address the dearth of empirical data.
The experiments revealed that apparent complex changes in social behavior can occur without the need for partner recognition.
Measurements in a mutant gene that led to a shift in social behavior provided support for the model of social signal production and response.
Simple measurements of social signaling can explain complex patterns of variation in social behavior observed in wild isolates.
The studies suggest that there is a novel and elegantly simple underlying mechanistic basis for natural variation in complex social strategies in D. discoideum.
The findings indicate that simple rules governing interactions between individuals can be sufficient to generate diverse and seemingly complex outcomes.
The text highlights the lack of knowledge regarding these mechanisms and emphasizes the need to address this gap in empirical data.
The purpose is to facilitate the co-translational translocation of secreted proteins.
Yes, studies have shown that mSMP recruitment to the ER in eukaryotes can occur independently of these factors.
The motif is termed SECReTE, which stands for secretion-enhancing cis regulatory targeting element.
SECReTE motif is enriched in mRNAs encoding secretome proteins translated on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes and on the inner membrane of prokaryotes.
SECReTE consists of ≥10 nucleotide triplet repeats enriched with pyrimidine (C/U) every third base (i.e. NNY, where N = any nucleotide, Y = pyrimidine).
SECReTE can be present in both the untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as the coding regions of the mRNA.
These mutations lead to an increase in protein secretion in yeast.
A reduction in count leads to reduced protein secretion and physiological defects.
The addition of SECReTE to the 3'UTR leads to an increased secretion of the expressed protein from yeast cells.
SECReTE constitutes a novel RNA motif that facilitates ER-localized mRNA translation and protein secretion.
The primary viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti are dengue, Zika, and chikungunya.
Breeding populations of A. aegypti were first reported in California in 2013.
Genetic analysis indicates that the South Central US region was the likely source of the introduction of A. aegypti in Northern CA.
The objectives were to examine additional samples from Northern and Southern CA, include more southern US populations for comparison, and genotype a subset of samples at 15,698 SNPs.
Yes, Northern and Southern CA populations of A. aegypti are distinct.
The Northern CA populations of A. aegypti show higher genetic diversity than the Southern CA populations.
The Northern CA population was likely founded by an introduction from the South Central US region, while the Southern CA population likely came from the Southwest US/northern Mexico regions.
Yes, the genetic data suggests that the founding events giving rise to the populations in both Northern and Southern CA likely occurred before they were first recognized in 2013 and 2014 respectively.
Yes, the Northern CA population analyzed at multiple time-points, two years apart, is genetically stable, consistent with permanent in situ breeding.
The findings have implications for mosquito surveillance and vector control activities, not only in California but also in other regions where the distribution of this invasive mosquito is expanding.
They bioconvert organic substrates into energy-rich triacylglycerols (TAGs).
They sequenced and performed a comparative analysis of the 9.27 Mb R. opacus PD630 genome.
2017 enzymatic reactions were assigned to the 8632 genes identified in R. opacus PD630.
261 genes were implicated in the TAGs cycle of R. opacus PD630.
Rhodococcus synthesizes and stores uncommon straight-chain odd-carbon fatty acids, including pentadecanoic, heptadecanoic, and cis-heptadecenoic acids.
R. jostii RHA1, Ralstonia eutropha H16, and C. glutamicum 13032 were screened to identify bioconversion pathways.
190 compounds were screened for growth in the experiment.
The results were integrated into a working model of prokaryotic oleaginy.
Yes, Rhodococcus odd-carbon fatty acids are found abundantly in TAGs.
The R. opacus PD630 genome has a size of 9.27 Mb.
Oligonucleotide usage can be linked to properties such as codon usage, DNA base-stacking energy, and DNA structural conformation.
The purpose of the study was to assess the statistical information potential of different DNA 'word-sizes', explore how oligonucleotide frequencies differ in coding and non-coding regions, and investigate DNA composition and sequence patterns in prokaryotic organisms.
Hexanucleotide frequencies suggested that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short range correlated, indicating that information in prokaryotic genomes is encoded in short oligonucleotides.
Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes compared to GC-rich and free-living genomes.
The variation in oligonucleotide usage was mainly located in non-coding regions.
Bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content.
Coding regions showed greater bias in tetranucleotide usage compared to non-coding regions.
Non-coding regions were approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average.
Yes, pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within AT-rich and GC-rich genomes.
Tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was, on average, more dissimilar and less biased compared to free-living archaea and bacteria.
The unintended consequences of gene targeting in mouse models have not been thoroughly studied, but they include off-target effects that need to be further analyzed.
RNA-seq was used to evaluate targeted and neighboring gene expression in tissues from mutant mice compared with control mice.
Tissues from 44 homozygous mutants were analyzed in this study.
The two allele types evaluated were targeted trap mutations (TRAP) and deletion alleles (DEL).
Both targeting strategies inserted a bacterial beta-galactosidase reporter (LacZ) and a neomycin resistance selection cassette.
Up-regulated genes were found more frequently around DEL alleles compared to TRAP alleles.
The frequency of alleles with local down-regulated genes flanking DEL and TRAP targets was similar.
Factors that may contribute to the local effects on gene expression include compensatory regulation, loss or disruption of regulatory elements, exogenous promoter, removal of insulating DNA, disruption of chromatin organization, and presence of exogenous DNA.
Transcriptome analysis confirmed targeting in 97% of DEL alleles.
TRAP alleles were less likely to be confirmed as targeted (only 47%) compared to DEL alleles due to non-functional splice variants and splicing around the gene trap.
Dmrt1 is involved in the regulation of gonad development in vertebrates.
In medaka, Dmrt1 acts as a master sex-determining gene with a tightly controlled gonadal expression pattern.
A sequence motif in the 3′ UTR (D3U-box) mediates the transcript stability of dmrt1 mRNAs.
The two RNA-binding proteins have antagonizing properties and regulate either RNA stabilization in germ cells or degradation in the soma.
Targeting the D3U-box mediates either RNA stabilization in germ cells or degradation in the soma.
No, the D3U-box motif is conserved in other germ-cell transcripts as well.
The conservation of the D3U-box motif within dmrt1 genes of metazoans, along with the expression patterns of RNA binding proteins in subsets of germ cells, suggests a broader applicability of this mechanism in other vertebrates.
The D3U-box mediates either stabilization or degradation of RNA, depending on the targeting RNA binding proteins.
The text suggests that the expression patterns of the targeting RNA binding proteins are preserved in subsets of germ cells in other vertebrates as well.
The conservation of the D3U-box makes other germ-cell transcripts responsive to the same RNA binding proteins.
Mosquito vectors lay their eggs in the aquatic milieu.
During early embryogenesis, water passes freely through the transparent eggshell.
The third and innermost layer of the eggshell is called the serosal cuticle.
Serosal cuticle formation greatly reduces water flow and allows egg survival outside the water.
Aedes aegypti eggs can survive in a dry environment for ≥ 72 hours.
Darker-body individuals show greater resistance to desiccation than lighter ones in some adult insects.
The melanization-ERD hypothesis was confirmed by employing two Anopheles quadrimaculatus strains.
Serosal cuticle formation is fundamental for the establishment of an efficient ERD.
Egg viability outside the water is much higher in mosquitoes with darker eggshells than in those with lighter ones.
The influence of pigmentation on egg water balance is relevant to understanding the evolutionary history of insect egg coloration and considering species fitness and novel approaches for vector or pest insect control.
10%.

Helminthic parasite infections.
No, it has never been prospectively tested.
Rhesus monkeys.
Yes, it facilitated systemic infection.
It occurred at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts.
The AID50 SHIV-C dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls.
Yes, they had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads.
Control of helminth infections.
The fundamental question is how the multicellular system resists noise to acquire developmental reproducibility.
The researchers focused on vertebrate somitogenesis because somites are repeatedly reproduced in a single embryo, making it an ideal system to study developmental reproducibility.
The technical difficulty lies in manipulating the intensity of noise in experiments.
The model simulated the step-like gradient distribution of ERK activity in the presomitic mesoderm and its posterior stepwise shift, leading to regular somite formation.
The regularity of somite formation was maintained by the segmentation clock, which reduced the inherent somite irregularity caused by noise.
Removing the clock from the model predicted that the stepwise shift of ERK activity occurs at irregular timing and distance, resulting in somite size variation.
The model prediction about somite irregularity was confirmed by live imaging of ERK activity in zebrafish embryos.
The novel role of the segmentation clock is to contribute to noise-resistant developmental reproducibility by reducing somite irregularity.
Molecular processes are inherently stochastic at the single-cell level.
The reproducibility of embryonic development refers to the ability of a multicellular system to consistently produce similar developmental outcomes.
Oligomerization is important for the functionality of many proteins.
The interfacial interactions and overall packing geometry of the individual monomers.
The role of interfacial interactions and overall contact topology in the dynamic features acquired in the oligomeric state.
The collective dynamics are examined using an elastic network model.
The softest collective motions.
Yes, to a large extent they are conserved.
Oligomerization stiffens the interfacial regions.
Oligomerization confers new cooperative modes that exploit the rigid-body translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the intact monomers.
It sheds light on the mechanism of cooperative inhibition of hexameric N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase by arginine and on the allosteric regulation of UMP kinases.
The study highlights the significance of the particular quaternary design in selectively determining the oligomer dynamics congruent with required ligand-binding and allosteric activities.
Understanding the role of humans in the dispersal of animal pathogens is essential for controlling them effectively.
Newly developed Bayesian phylogeographic methods were used in this study.
Major geo-political boundaries acted as barriers to gene flow, leading to largely disconnected spatial dynamics in each country studied.
Road distances were found to be better predictors of dog rabies virus movement.
Yes, occasional long-distance and rapid spread of the virus was observed within each of the countries studied.
The viral distribution of dog rabies virus extends beyond what is expected for transmission within African dog populations, suggesting human-mediated dispersal.
By using an integrated phylogeographic approach, viral genetic data can be transformed into a powerful asset for characterizing, predicting, and potentially controlling the spatial spread of pathogens.
Phylogeographic methods bridge the gap between phylodynamics and spatial epidemiology, allowing for a better understanding of the dynamics and determinants of pathogen spread.
The study focused on North Africa.
Unraveling the dynamics and determinants of pathogen spread is important for controlling and potentially preventing the further spread of diseases.
Brazil is expected to host about 600,000 foreign visitors during the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
The concern is the high transmission rates reported in the past by Brazil, which raises the possibility of dengue transmission during the event.
The percentile rank (PR) and Empirical Bayes (EB) models were used.
The expected incidence rates were generally low, with most being less than 10 cases per 100,000 people.
Yes, the predictions varied across locations and between the percentile rank (PR) and Empirical Bayes (EB) models.
The mean number of expected symptomatic dengue cases ranged from 26 to 59 among foreign tourists.
No, none are expected among the teams.
The actual travel schedules and dengue immunity among visitors can influence the number of expected dengue cases.
The expected number of cases can be as low as 4 or 5 with 100,000 visitors, and as high as 38 or 70 with 800,000 visitors.
Quantitative risk estimates by different groups and methodologies should be made routinely for mass gathering events like the World Cup.
The goal is to combat obesity.
The study profiled C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cell line.
Stage- and lineage-specific coding genes, lncRNAs, and microRNAs were systematically identified.
Super-enhancers are a type of enhancer. The chromatin state maps helped define stage- and lineage-specific enhancers, including super-enhancers.
In brown adipocytes, brown lineage-specific genes are pre-marked by both H3K4me1 and H3K27me3. The removal of H3K27me3 is necessary, but not sufficient, to promote brown gene expression, while the pre-deposition of H3K4me1 plays an essential role in poising the brown genes for expression in mature brown cells.
SOX13 is part of a p38 MAPK dependent transcriptional response mediating early brown cell lineage commitment.
PIM1, SIX1, and RREB1 were identified and subsequently validated as novel regulators promoting brown adipogenesis.
SIX1 binds to adipogenic and brown marker genes and interacts with C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and EBF2, suggesting their functional cooperation during adipogenesis.
C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cell line was used in the study.
Removing H3K27me3 at the late stage is necessary to promote brown gene expression.
Serological tests are used for the diagnosis and follow-up of PCM (paracoccidioidomycosis).
Different protocols and antigen preparations are used by different centers, leading to a lack of standardization.
Each center provided 30 sera of PCM patients and applied its own antigen preparation and serological routine test to the sera from the other five centers.
The titers were transformed into scores of 0 (negative), 1 (healing titers), 2 (active disease, low titers), and 3 (active disease, high titers) according to each center's criteria.
Major discordances were considered between scores indicating active disease and scores indicating negative or healing titers.
All centers exhibited a high rate of "major" discordances, with an average of 31 (20%) discordant scores.
A high rate of major discordances was also found, with an average of 14.8 sera out of 30 presenting a discordance with at least one other center.
Centers that used counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and a pool of isolates for antigen preparation performed better.
The inconsistencies can lead to conflicting information regarding the patients' treatment.
The author suggests that renewed efforts should be promoted to improve the standardization of the serological diagnosis of PCM.
Hookworm-related CLM is a tropical skin disease caused by the migration of animal hookworm larvae in the epidermis.
CLM is characterized by intense pruritus (itching) and is associated with significant morbidity.
The study was conducted in Manaus, Brazil, specifically in resource-poor communities.
Skin disease-associated life quality was assessed using a modified version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (mDLQI) scores.
91.5% of the participants showed a considerable reduction in skin disease-associated life quality.
The degree of impairment in CLM patients correlated with the intensity of infection, the number of affected body areas, and the presence of lesions on visible areas of the skin.
The most frequent restrictions in skin disease-associated life quality reported by the patients were intense pruritus, sleep disturbance (due to itching), and feelings of shame.
No differences were observed in skin disease-associated life quality restrictions between boys and girls or men and women.
Two weeks after treatment with ivermectin, skin disease-associated life quality significantly improved.
After four weeks of treatment, 73.3% of the patients considered their disease-associated life quality to have returned to normal.
The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is the main parasite reservoir.
Lutzomyia longipalpis is the species responsible for transmitting the parasite.
Countries including Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and more recently Uruguay have experienced the spread of Lutzomyia longipalpis.
The study evaluated bionomic parameters including daily survival rate, duration of the gonotrophic cycle, and dispersal pattern of the Lu. longipalpis population.
The mark-release-recapture method was used to evaluate the bionomic parameters.
The higher recapture rates occurred within 100 meters of the release point.
The estimated daily survival rates for females varied between 0.69 and 0.89.
The minimum duration observed for the gonotrophic cycle was five days.
The absolute population size ranged from 900 to 4,857 females and from 2,882 to 9,543 males.
The findings of this study provide important data for understanding ZVL dynamics and evaluating the implementation of prevention and control measures.
The primary niche of infecting EPEC is the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells.
EPEC employs a type three secretion system (TTSS) to inject host cells with effector proteins.
EPEC infection in developing countries is associated with a high risk of mortality, particularly in infants with diarrhea.
No, the data indicate that active, pore-forming TTSS itself is sufficient for NF-κB activation, regardless of any specific effector or protein translocation.
NF-κB activation is antagonized by anti-NF-κB effectors in wild type EPEC, while it is evident only in cells infected with EPEC mutants deleted of nleB, nleC, and nleE.
No, the TTSS-dependent NF-κB activation is independent of TLRs and Nod1/2.
The TTSS-dependent NF-κB activation pathway converges with other pathways at the level of TAK1 activation.
The results imply that epithelial cells have the capacity to sense the EPEC TTSS and activate NF-κB in response.
EPEC counteracts the activation of NF-κB by delivering anti-NF-κB effectors into the infected cells.
EPEC antagonizes NF-κB activation using anti-NF-κB effectors, including NleB, NleC, and NleE.
The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the most common RNA binding domain across eukaryotic proteins, and it is valuable to engineer its specificity to target RNAs of any sequence.
The RRM in Rbfox protein was used in recent research to achieve specific targeting of oncogenic miRNA 21.
The four mutations designed were R118D, E147R, N151S, and E152T.
A variety of molecular dynamics-based approaches were used to predict specific interactions at the binding interface.
Approximately 50 microseconds of enhanced sampling and plain molecular dynamics simulations were run on both the engineered complex and the wild-type Rbfox·pre-miRNA 20b.
The comparison with available NMR data on the wild type molecules (protein, RNA, and their complex) served to establish the accuracy of the calculations.
The free energy calculations suggest that the S151T replacement achieves further improvements in affinity and selectivity.
It is valuable to engineer the specificity of the RRM domain to target RNAs of arbitrary sequence.
The RRM domain is the most common RNA binding domain across eukaryotic proteins.
The research discussed in the text targeted the precursor to the oncogenic miRNA 21.
Serine proteases are recognized as antigens during host infection.
The unique domain organization found in trypsin-like serine proteases in flatworm parasites is the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR-1) domain.
Schistosoma mansoni is one of the major species responsible for schistosomiasis.
SmSP2 comprises three domains: a histidine stretch, TSR-1, and a serine protease domain.
The cleavage specificity of recombinant SmSP2 was determined to be a trypsin-like endopeptidase mode of action.
SmSP2 activates tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen, which are key components of the fibrinolytic system.
SmSP2 releases the vasoregulatory peptide, kinin, from kininogen.
SmSP2 is detected in the surface tegument, esophageal glands, and reproductive organs of the adult parasite.
SmSP2 is detected in the excretory/secretory products by immunoblotting.
SmSP2 may contribute to the survival of the parasite by manipulating host vasodilatation and fibrinolysis, suggesting it could be a potential target for anti-schistosomal therapy.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV).
The role of γδ T cells in protection from CMV has not been firmly established, and their dependency on other lymphocytes has not been addressed.
γδ T cells are as competent as αβ T cells in protecting mice from CMV-induced death.
γδ T cells control viral load and prevent organ damage, thereby providing protection against CMV.
CD3ε−/− mice were rescued from CMV-induced death through bone marrow transplant or adoptive transfer of γδ T cells.
Different γδ T cell subsets, including both CD27+ and CD27− γδ T cells, were induced upon CMV challenge in humans.
The CMV-induced response of γδ T cells was observed in the liver and lungs.
NK cells were the main producers of IFNγ and cytotoxic granules during CMV infection.
No, the protective role of γδ T cells did not principally rely on either of these two functions.
Yes, γδ T cells can act in the absence of B and NK cells as demonstrated by their ability to fully protect Rag−/−γc−/− mice from death.
The ICP protein is a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteases expressed throughout the life cycle of Plasmodium parasites.
The purpose was to analyze the role of PbICP in different stages of the Plasmodium berghei life cycle.
The excision of the pbicb gene occurred in infective sporozoites.
Sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes was impaired as a result of pbicb gene excision.
The majority of the parasites invading a cultured hepatocyte cell line did not develop to mature liver stages.
Yes, the blood stage parasites lacking PbICP were able to infect mosquitoes and develop to the oocyst stage.
PbICP-negative sporozoites exhibited defective motility and invaded mosquito salivary glands in low numbers.
No, PbICP-negative sporozoites were unable to invade hepatocytes.
Control of cysteine protease activity is critical for sporozoites.
Yes, transfection with a pbicp-gfp construct fully reversed the observed defects in PbICP-knockout parasites.
The H2A.Z variant is essential for embryonic development and plays a role in controlling gene expression programs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
The amino acid sequence of H2A.Z contains divergent regions, such as three specific residues in the C-terminal acidic patch, which are different from the core histone H2A.
The C-terminal acidic patch domain of H2A.Z resides on the surface of the histone octamer and its specific residues likely contribute to chromatin structure and function.
The amino acids Gly92, Asp97, and Ser98 in the H2A.Z C-terminal acidic patch (H2A.ZAP3) are critical for lineage commitment during ESC differentiation.
H2A.Z is enriched at most H3K4me3 promoters in ESCs, including poised, bivalent promoters that harbor both activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) marks.
The H2A.ZAP3 mutant, despite showing a similar distribution pattern to wild-type H2A.Z, has reduced enrichment levels at target promoters.
Bivalent genes in H2A.ZAP3 ESCs displayed significant changes in expression compared to active genes.
Bivalent genes in H2A.ZAP3 ESCs gained the H3.3 variant, which is associated with higher nucleosome turnover.
H2A.ZAP3 displays higher mobility in chromatin compared to wild-type H2A.Z, as observed through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).
Treatment of ESCs with flavopiridol decreases the mobility fraction of H2A.ZAP3 and increases its occupancy at target genes, suggesting proper incorporation of the mutant into chromatin.
The laboratory developed a retrospective method using somatic mutations accumulated in microsatellites.
The method was applied to explore different aspects of stem cell dynamics in the mouse colon without the use of stem cell markers.
The findings confirmed that colon crypts are monoclonal and that monoclonal conversion plays a major role in their maintenance throughout adulthood.
The age-dependent accumulation of microsatellite mutations validated the absence of an immortal strand mechanism in colon crypt stem cells.
The study confirmed a positive correlation between the physical and lineage proximity of crypts, indicating that the colon is separated into small domains that share a common ancestor.
The study revealed that the colon epithelium is clustered separately from hematopoietic and other cell types, suggesting that the colon is constituted of few progenitors and does not significantly renew from hematopoietic cells during adulthood.
The study demonstrates the reliability of cell lineage reconstruction for studying stem cell dynamics.
The study addressed open questions regarding colon stem cells.
Yes, the method can be applied to study stem cell dynamics in other systems.
The laboratory first established the reliability of their method by confirming previously established facts about stem cells.
The objective is to develop strategies for eradicating infectious HIV from patients.
Killing persisting HIV infected cells is essential for a successful eradication therapy.
ART can reduce HIV levels in plasma to undetectable levels.
The study focuses on the effects of ART outside of the peripheral blood, specifically regarding persistent virus production in tissue reservoirs.
Antiretroviral drug penetration and activity are sufficient to reduce HIV production in each tested tissue, although elimination is not achieved.
Persistent vRNA+ cells in bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) humanized mice were treated with an HIV-specific immunotoxin.
The targeted cytotoxic therapy profoundly depleted systemically infected cells compared to ART alone.
The proof-of-concept suggests that targeted cytotoxic therapies can be effective components of HIV eradication strategies.
The study used a targeted cytotoxic therapy to kill infected cells.
ART was found to be sufficient to reduce, but not eliminate, HIV production in each tested organ.
Rapid diagnosis of dengue can assist patient triage and management.
Detection of the dengue viral protein, NS1, represents a new approach to dengue diagnosis.
The Platelia NS1 ELISA assay was modestly more sensitive (82%) than the NS1 LFRT (72%) in confirmed dengue cases.
Both ELISA and LFRT assays were more sensitive for primary than secondary dengue.
The presence of measurable DENV-reactive IgG in the test sample was associated with a significantly lower rate of NS1 detection in both assays.
NS1 positivity was associated with a significantly higher viraemia compared to NS1-negative samples.
The Platelia and NS1 LFRT were 100% specific, being negative in all febrile patients without evidence of recent dengue, as well as in patients with enteric fever, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and leptospirosis.
Yes, the data suggest NS1 assays deserve inclusion in the diagnostic evaluation of dengue patients.
Due consideration should be given to the limitations of NS1 assays for patients who present late in their illness.
The presence of measurable DENV-reactive IgM in the test sample was associated with a lesser extent of NS1 detection in both assays.
Around 59,000 human deaths are caused by rabies annually.
Almost all human rabies cases are caused by bites from rabies-infected dogs.
A large proportion of human rabies cases occur in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA).
The World Health Organization recommends annual vaccination of at least 70% of the dog population to eliminate rabies.
Achieving high vaccination coverage is challenging in low resource settings due to logistical and economic constraints.
Static point (SP) vaccination campaigns refer to a method of vaccination where a fixed location is designated for administering free rabies vaccinations to dogs.
Static point vaccination campaigns often suffer from low attendance and result in low vaccination coverage.
Distance plays a crucial role in attendance at static point vaccination campaigns, with the odds of attending increasing by 3.3 times for every kilometer closer to the location.
Very few people are willing to travel more than 1.5 kilometers to bring their dogs for vaccination at a static point.
Some reasons mentioned by dog owners for not attending a static point vaccination campaign include lack of awareness (27%) and inability to handle their dog (19%).
The parasites are transmitted to mammalian hosts through the bite of an infected tsetse.
Information on tsetse-trypanosome interactions in the salivary gland tissue is sparse.
Only 2.7% of the contigs are differentially expressed during salivary gland infection.
Only 263 contigs (0.6%) are preferentially expressed in the salivary glands.
The suppressed contigs accounted for over 55% of the salivary gland transcriptome and included the most abundant putative secreted proteins with anti-hemostatic functions present in saliva.
Putative host proteins associated with immunity, stress, cell division, and tissue remodeling were enriched in infected salivary glands.
RNA-seq analysis was performed on mouse blood infected with the same parasite strain.
Over 30% of parasite transcripts are differentially regulated between the two stages.
The differences include a switch from an amino acid-based metabolism in the salivary glands to one based on glucose utilization in the blood, as well as surface coat modifications that enable parasite survival in different hosts.
The study provides a foundation for understanding the molecular aspects of the trypanosome's interaction with its tsetse and mammalian hosts, which is necessary for future functional investigations.
The bacterial strains showed activity against Escovopsis, which is a fungal pathogen.
The bacterial strains also showed activity against the human protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani.
Mer-A2026B (1), piericidin-A1 (2), and nigericin (3) were isolated from the Streptomyces sp. ICBG292 culture.
Nigericin (3) showed high activity against intracellular amastigotes of L. donovani.
Streptomyces puniceus ICBG378, isolated from workers of Acromyrmex rugosus rugosus, produced dinactin (4) with potent anti-L. donovani activity.
The selectivity indexes for compounds 3 and 4 were 88.91 and 656.11, respectively.
Yes, compounds 3 and 4 were more active than the positive control, miltefosine.
Yes, compounds 1-4 were also active against some strains of Escovopsis.
Streptomyces sp. ICBG233, isolated from workers of Atta sexdens, also produced compounds 1 and 2.
Compounds 1 and 2 are suggested to be produced as defensive compounds involved in the symbiotic interaction in the natural environment.
African trypanosomes can undergo their complete morphological life cycle in the tsetse fly vector, with mating being a non-obligatory part.
Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infects humans and livestock in East and Southern Africa.
T. b. rhodesiense has been described as a host-range variant of the non-human infective Trypanosoma brucei existing as stable clonal lineages.
A panel of microsatellite markers was used to examine T. b. rhodesiense populations from Uganda and Malawi, incorporating both spatial and temporal analyses.
The Ugandan T. b. rhodesiense populations existed as clonal populations with a small number of highly related genotypes and substantial linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci. However, the dominant genotypes changed over time, and the genetic diversity also reduced.
No, the Ugandan T. b. rhodesiense populations did not conform to the criterion of strict clonality as the dominant genotypes changed over time.
The previously dominant genotypes in Uganda were not detected in the mid-1990s. They were replaced by a novel clonal population with limited genetic relationship to the original population.
The population of T. b. rhodesiense in Malawi demonstrates significantly greater diversity and evidence for frequent genetic exchange compared to the Ugandan population.
The complexity in the population genetics of T. b. rhodesiense has important implications for the spread of the single copy T. b. rhodesiense gene allowing human infectivity and the epidemiology of the human disease. It also suggests that these parasites are important to study the influence of optional recombination on population genetic dynamics.
Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense is studied to understand the influence of optional recombination on population genetic dynamics.
STDP changes the structure of networks of neurons based on firing activity to help the brain learn patterns and process information.
Previous studies have shown that STDP selectively potentiates feed-forward connections with specific axonal delays, which plays a role in auditory functions like sound localization in barn owls.
The study aimed to investigate how STDP leads to the selective potentiation of recurrent connections with different axonal and dendritic delays during oscillatory activity.
The researchers developed analytical models of learning with additive STDP in recurrent networks driven by oscillatory inputs and supported the results using simulations with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.
The results showed selective potentiation of connections with specific axonal delays, depending on the input frequency, and how it led to the network becoming selective in the amplitude of its oscillatory response to that frequency.
Yes, the research model expanded the understanding by showing the selective potentiation of connections with a range of both axonal and dendritic delays, and axonal delay selection between multiple groups receiving out-of-phase, oscillatory inputs.
The researchers discussed the application of these models to the formation and activation of neuronal ensembles or cell assemblies in the cortex and to missing fundamental pitch perception in the auditory brainstem.
Learning rules like STDP change the structure of networks of neurons based on firing activity.
Sound localization in the auditory brainstem of barn owls has been linked to the selective potentiation of feed-forward connections with specific axonal delays.
The simulations supporting the analytical models used leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.
The purpose is to prevent human cases of Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis.
No, currently there are no systemic insecticides registered against these flies in dogs.
A Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (SEI) compartmental model was developed.
Transmission occurs via phlebotomine flies.
It was modeled as having two levels: high infectiousness and low infectiousness.
Human incidence is estimated through its relationship to infection in the dog population.
The parameters evaluated included initial insecticide efficacy, duration of insecticide efficacy over time, and proportion of the dog population treated (60%, 70%, & 80%).
Yes, different combinations of insecticide efficacy, duration, and dog coverage can achieve the same reduction in human infection incidence.
At least 70% of the dogs would need to be treated.
The baseline values of phlebotomine fly daily survival rate and insecticide coverage were found to be the most influential factors on the model outcome.
The invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium merozoites requires specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands.
The parasite proteins that bind erythrocyte receptors are localized in apical organelles called micronemes and rhoptries.
The regulated secretion of microneme and rhoptry proteins to the merozoite surface, enabling receptor binding, is a critical step in the invasion process.
The sequence of secretion events and the external signals that trigger release are not known.
Time-lapse video microscopy has been used to study changes in intracellular calcium levels in Plasmodium falciparum merozoites during erythrocyte invasion.
Flow cytometry-based methods have been developed to measure relative levels of cytosolic calcium and study surface expression of apical organelle proteins in P. falciparum merozoites in response to different external signals.
Exposure of P. falciparum merozoites to low potassium ion concentrations leads to a rise in cytosolic calcium levels.
A rise in cytosolic calcium levels in P. falciparum merozoites occurs through a phospholipase C mediated pathway.
When cytosolic calcium levels rise, microneme proteins such as the 175 kD erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA175) and apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) are triggered to be secreted to the merozoite surface.
The interaction of EBA175 with glycophorin A on erythrocytes restores basal cytosolic calcium levels and triggers the release of rhoptry proteins.
The common properties are the lack of structural and morphological integrity, resulting in leaky vessels.
Elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and low blood perfusion act as barriers for drug delivery.
Normalization of vasculature is considered a viable option.
Insight is needed into the phenomenon of normalization and the conditions under which it can realize its promise.
The mathematical model incorporates tumor growth, angiogenesis, and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP).
They are administered through heterogeneous vasculature that resembles tumor vasculature.
Depending on the therapy scheduling, differences in drug extravasation were observed.
Total drug extravasation is increased in concurrent therapy.
In adjuvant therapy, drugs can penetrate into deeper regions of the tumor.
The overall aim is to explore the effect of microenvironmental conditions and drug scheduling on the potential benefits of vasculature normalization.
Myeloid DCs can facilitate virus dissemination to CD4+ T cells via a trans infection pathway.
The trans infection pathway is dependent on virion incorporation of a host cell-derived glycosphingolipid (GSL) called GM3.
CD4+ T cells make exploratory contacts on the DC surface, which can result in infection of multiple T cells.
Activation of DCs with ligands that induce the type I IFN signaling pathway dramatically enhances DC-mediated T cell trans infection.
The type I IFN-inducible receptor Siglec-1 (CD169) is the DC receptor that captures HIV.
Selective downregulation of CD169 expression, neutralizing CD169 function, or depletion of GSLs from virions can abrogate DC-mediated HIV-1 capture and trans infection.
Yes, exogenous expression of CD169 in receptor-naïve cells can rescue GSL-dependent capture and trans infection.
HIV-1 particles co-localize with CD169 on the DC surface immediately following capture.
HIV-1 particles redistribute within non-lysosomal compartments of DCs and then to the DC – T cell infectious synapses.
The findings describe a novel mechanism of pathogen parasitization, involving the interaction between GM3 and CD169, for DC-dependent HIV dissemination.
Chondrocytes embed themselves in a proteoglycan-rich matrix and undergo a developmental transition called "maturation.".
Chondrocytes express ihh to induce bone development in the overlying tissue, the perichondrium.
Zebrafish mutants show that cartilage proteoglycans (PGs) inhibit chondrocyte maturation and influence the timing of perichondral bone development.
Mutants had decreased cartilage matrix and increased perichondral bone formation compared to their wild-type siblings.
The genes fam20b and xylosyltransferase1 (xylt1) were identified as encoding PG synthesis enzymes.
The mutants failed to produce normal levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs, which are abundant in cartilage matrix.
Mutants with fam20b and xylt1 mutations initiated perichondral bone formation earlier than their wild-type counterparts.
Mutant chondrocytes showed precocious initiation of maturation, increased and early expression of markers like runx2b, collagen type 10a1, and ihh co-orthologs, and suppression of early perichondral bone formation when ihha was mutated.
Ultrastructural analyses showed aberrant matrix organization and early cellular features of chondrocyte hypertrophy in the mutants.
In addition to their involvement in PG synthesis, fam20b and xylt1 genes regulate cartilage matrix production and ultimately determine the timing of skeletal development.
SFTS is caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a tick-borne phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae.
Humans, domestic animals, and wildlife animals can be infected by the SFTSV.
The viral ecology, circulation, and transmission of SFTS remain largely unknown.
Sixty-seven human SFTS cases were reported and confirmed between 2011 and 2014.
Ticks were collected from both vegetation and small wild mammals in the endemic area in Jiangsu, China, and they were found to be carrying SFTSV-RNA.
Viral RNA was identified in larvae of the tick species Haemaphysalis longicornis prior to a first blood meal.
Wild mammals such as Erinaceus europaeus and Sorex araneus were found to have SFTSV-RNA and antibodies.
A live SFTSV was isolated from Erinaceus europaeus, which was captured during the off tick-feeding season.
Migratory birds such as Anser cygnoides and Streptopelia chinensis showed the presence of SFTSV antibodies.
These findings provide novel insights into SFTSV ecology, reservoir hosts, and transmission, which can help develop new measures in preventing its rapid spread both regionally and globally.
Large dsDNA viruses can cause a profound alteration of the host transcriptome and metabolome.
A host's response to viral infection can result in diverse phenotypic outcomes, including a shift in the host's life cycle and activation of anti-viral defense response.
The challenge lies in discerning between viral hijacking strategies and host defense responses when averaging the bulk population response.
The research focused on the interaction between Emiliania huxleyi, a bloom-forming alga, and its specific virus (EhV).
The gene expression of host and virus was quantified on a single-cell resolution using an automatic microfluidic setup that captures individual algal cells and multiplex quantitative PCR.
There was high heterogeneity in viral gene expression among individual cells.
Simultaneous measurements allowed mapping of infected cells into newly defined infection states and detection of specific host responses in a subpopulation of infected cells, which would be otherwise masked by the majority of the infected population.
Resistant cells during viral infection showed unique expression profiles of metabolic genes.
The expression profiles of metabolic genes in resistant cells can help differentiate between viral resistant and susceptible cells within heterogeneous populations in the marine environment.
Studying the host-virus arms race at a single-cell level can provide important mechanistic insights into viral life cycles and uncover host defense strategies.
Guilt-by-association is the idea that a gene's function is influenced by its position within a biological network.
When a gene's network context is changed, such as in a disease condition, it can also impact the gene's function.
No, the potential changes induced by context-specific alterations in biological networks on gene functions are yet to be fully understood.
The study utilized transcriptomic samples from breast tumors and healthy breast tissues to derive sample-specific protein interaction networks and assign sample-specific functions to genes using a diffusion strategy.
Yes, several functions were found to have gained or lost genes in cancer samples, which was not solely due to differential expression of known genes associated with those functions. The changes were a result of alterations in network topology.
The predicted functional changes were supported by mutational and copy number profiles observed in breast cancers.
The diffusion-based functional assignment offers a unique characterization of a tumor that complements the traditional approach based solely on functional annotation.
The novel characterization based on diffusion-based functional assignment is effective in predicting patient survival and several known histopathological subtypes of breast cancer.
The dataset used included transcriptomic samples from 1047 breast tumors and 110 healthy breast tissues obtained from TCGA.
Yes, the study demonstrates that changes in network topology play a role in inducing functional changes in breast cancer.
The overall hypothesis is that host population immunity directed at multiple antigens will influence the prevalence, diversity, and evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) in avian populations.
Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were used in the experimental infections.
The mallards were pre-challenged with an H3N8 low-pathogenic IAV.
The mallards were divided into six groups.
The mallards were challenged with different IAV subtypes, namely H4N5, H10N7, H6N2, H12N5, or the same H3N8.
Yes, the mallards were still resistant to re-infection after 15 weeks.
The outcome of the heterologous challenges varied depending on the hemagglutinin (HA) phylogenetic relatedness between the viruses used.
Yes, there was a boost in the H3 antibody titer after re-infection with H4N5.
The boost in the H3 antibody titer suggests original antigenic sin or antigenic seniority, indicating a putative strategy of virus evasion.
The results provide insights into within-host IAV complex interactions as drivers of IAV antigenic diversity, which could allow the circulation of multiple subtypes in wild ducks.
Horizontal gene transfer mediated by plasmid conjugation plays a significant role in the evolution of bacterial species, as well as in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants.
Relatively little is known about how conjugation of Gram-positive plasmids is regulated.
Conjugation of the native Bacillus subtilis plasmid pLS20 is not activated by recipient-produced pheromones but by pLS20-encoded proteins that regulate expression of the conjugation genes.
Conjugation is kept in the default "OFF" state.
The master repressor is responsible for keeping conjugation in the "OFF" state.
The repression of conjugation is relieved by an anti-repressor that belongs to the Rap family of proteins.
The researchers determined the regulatory effects of the repressor and anti-repressor on expression of the pLS20 genes through both RNA sequencing methodology and genetic approaches.
The activity of the anti-repressor is regulated by an intercellular signaling peptide.
The intercellular signaling peptide dictates the timing of conjugation.
The implications of this regulatory mechanism and comparison with other mobile systems are discussed, but the specific details are not mentioned in the given text.
The primary vector of dengue virus infection in humans is the mosquito Aedes aegypti.
The most important arbovirus in the subtropics and tropics is the dengue virus (DENV).
The early time periods after infection with the dengue virus determine the success or failure of the virus to establish infection in the mosquito.
The researchers performed genome-wide transcriptome profiling between susceptible and refractory Aedes aegypti strains at two critical early periods after challenging them with dengue virus (DENV).
Genes that responded to DENV infection in the susceptible strain were largely clustered in one specific expression module, whereas in the refractory strain they were distributed in four distinct modules.
The susceptible response module showed significant biased representation with genes related to energy metabolism and DNA replication.
The refractory response modules showed biased representation across different metabolism pathway genes including cytochrome P450 and DDT degradation genes, and genes associated with cell growth and death.
The common core set of genes expressed in both susceptible and refractory mosquitoes included genes related to the Wnt, MAPK, mTOR, and JAK-STAT pathways.
The extensive transcriptional networks of mosquito genes indicate that successfully defending against viral infection requires more elaborate gene networks than hosting the virus.
Gene networks likely play important roles in the global cross-talk among mosquito host factors that trigger the appropriate host action in susceptible versus refractory mosquitoes during the critical early periods of DENV infection.
Loiasis is endemic in the rainforest zone of west and central Africa, particularly in Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Repeated treatments with ivermectin are delivered using the annual community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) approach.
The objective of the study is to explore the effects of several rounds of CDTI on parasitological indicators of loiasis.
The study was conducted in the East, Northwest, and Southwest 2 CDTI projects of Cameroon.
Individuals who consented to participate were interviewed for ivermectin treatment history and enrolled for parasitological screening using thick smears.
The loiasis prevalence in the non-CDTI district of the East region was 29.3% (range = 24.2%–34.6%).
Yes, in the Northwest and Southwest 2 districts, there was a reduction in loiasis prevalence from 30.5% to 17.9% (after 9 ivermectin rounds) and from 8.1% to 7.8% (not significantly different after 14 rounds), respectively.
There was a negative relationship between adherence to ivermectin treatment and loiasis prevalence/intensity in all sites.
None of the children (aged 10–14 years) examined in the East CDTI project harbored high (8,000–30,000 mf/ml) or very high (>30,000 mf/ml) microfilarial loads.
In areas where onchocerciasis and loiasis are co-endemic, CDTI reduces the number of, and microfilaraemia in L. loa-infected individuals, thereby helping to prevent non-neurological and neurological complications post-ivermectin treatment among CDTI adherents.
There is a bias towards co-orientation of replication and transcription.
Essential and/or highly-expressed genes are further enriched in the co-directional orientation.
Reversing the bias slowed down replication elongation.
The researchers proposed that the slowed replication contributes to the evolutionary pressure selecting the bias.
The selective pressure might be based on speedy replication or preservation of genome integrity.
They generated new strains with inversions in the chromosome or at ribosomal RNA operons.
The replication rates varied dramatically within the inverted genome.
Replication was moderately impeded throughout the inverted region.
The obstruction resulted in disruption of DNA replication, activation of DNA damage responses, loss of genome integrity, and cell death.
The results strongly suggest that preservation of genome integrity drives the evolution of co-orientation of replication and transcription, a conserved feature of genome organization.
Schistosomiasis.
Advances in functional genomics in schistosomes and related neglected tropical disease pathogens.
Blood stream forms of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni.
Fusion of virions to schistosome cells, internalization of the nucleocapsid, and reverse transcription of the RNA genome.
Anchored PCR analysis, sequencing HIV-1-specific anchored Illumina libraries, and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).
Over 8,000 integrations throughout the eight pairs of chromosomes.
Approximately 2,100 integrations, equivalent to about two or three events per cell.
Integration bias in schistosomes was dissimilar to that of human T cells.
Schistosomes were capable of accomplishing post-entry processes essential for HIV-1 replication, including integrase-catalyzed integration, despite the phylogenetic distance between schistosomes and primates.
It provided the first demonstration that HIV-1 can integrate into the genome of an invertebrate, S. mansoni, and revealed that HIV-1 was active within schistosome cells.
Leptospirosis is caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp.
Rats serve as asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic Leptospira and are critical for disease spread.
Leptospira colonizes the kidney of reservoir hosts.
Leptospires gain access to a new mammalian host through breaches in the skin.
The purpose of the proteomic analyses is to determine the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the leptospiral protein, LipL32.
Acetylation or tri-methylation of lysine residues within multiple LipL32 peptides were observed.
The unique presence of PTMs in in vivo-isolated leptospires suggests that infection-generated modification of leptospiral proteins may have a biologically relevant function during the course of infection.
The identity of each modified lysine residue was confirmed by fragmentation pattern analysis of the peptide mass spectra.
A synthetic peptide containing tri-methylated lysine showed significantly reduced immunoreactivity compared to the peptide version lacking tri-methylation.
LipL32 modification may represent a novel mechanism of immune evasion within Leptospira.
The main goal of new T cell vaccines is to generate large populations of long-lived pathogen-specific effector memory CD8 T cells.
Prior infection history has an impact on the host immune response.
The order in which infections are acquired could have a major effect on the host immune response.
Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and human Adenovirus-subtype (AdHu5) 5-beta-galactosidase (Ad-lacZ) vector were used to investigate the impact of new infections.
Simultaneous and sequential infections with MCMV and Ad-lacZ generated inflationary populations towards both viruses with similar kinetics and magnitude to mono-infected groups.
In Ad-lacZ immune mice, subsequent acute MCMV infection led to a rapid decline of the pre-existing Ad-LacZ-specific inflating population.
The decline of the pre-existing Ad-LacZ-specific inflating population was associated with bystander activation of Fas-dependent apoptotic pathways.
Yes, the responses of the memory cells were maintained long-term.
Boosting with Ad-lacZ led to rapid re-expansion of the inflating population.
No, immunization with an AdHu5 vector did not alter the size of the pre-existing memory.
Sexual dimorphisms in trait expression refer to differences in physical traits between males and females of a species.
Ornaments and weapons are examples of sexually selected traits that can attain exaggerated sizes.
Exaggerated traits are usually male-specific and influenced by nutrition sensitivity.
The two developmental mechanisms likely to regulate the expression of extreme structures are sexually dimorphic growth and nutrition-dependent phenotypic plasticity.
Doublesex genes encode transcription factors that orchestrate male and female specific trait development.
Juvenile hormone acts as a mediator between nutrition and mandible growth in the stag beetle.
Knockdown of Cmdsx gene in both males and females resulted in intersex phenotypes.
Knockdown of Cmdsx increased the sensitivity of female mandibles to JH treatment.
Knockdown of Cmdsx partially reduced the sensitivity of male mandibles to JH treatment.
This study demonstrates a causal link between sex determination and JH signaling pathways, highlighting their interaction in determining the development and final sizes of nutrition-dependent secondary-sexual characters.
T2D is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and hypoinsulinemia due to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction.
Reduced mitochondrial function is thought to be central to β-cell dysfunction.
Down syndrome (DS, Trisomy 21) exhibits mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion in β-cells.
The Ts65Dn and Dp16 DS mouse lines were hyperglycemic.
No, Tc1 and Ts1Rhr mice did not exhibit hyperglycemia.
RCAN1 was identified as a candidate gene linking hyperglycemia and functional changes in T2D β-cells.
RCAN1 methylation is reduced in human T2D islets at multiple sites.
RCAN1 protein expression is increased in db/db mouse islets and in human and mouse islets exposed to high glucose.
Reduced β-cell ATP negatively affects both glucose-stimulated membrane depolarization and ATP-dependent insulin granule exocytosis.
Through a trisomy 21 screening approach, RCAN1 was linked to β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction in T2D.
Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses.
More than 21,000 nucleotide sequences of rabies viruses have been deposited in public databases.
Phylogenetic analyses combined with metadata have been used to suggest geographic distributions of RABV.
These analyses experience technical difficulties in defining verifiable criteria for cluster allocations in phylogenetic trees.
The study applied a mathematical clustering algorithm named 'affinity propagation clustering' (AP).
The affinity propagation clustering algorithm is computationally fast and works for any meaningful measure of similarity between data samples.
The affinity propagation clustering algorithm has previously been applied successfully in bioinformatics, for analysis of microarray and gene expression data.
516 existing and 46 original full genome RABV sequences were used in this study.
The affinity propagation clustering algorithm proposed four clusters on a global scale.
By combining the affinity propagation clustering algorithm with established phylogenetic analyses, it is possible to resolve phylogenetic relationships between verifiably determined clusters and sequences.
Myelin is essential for rapid saltatory conduction in the nervous system.
Schwann cells produce myelin in the peripheral nervous system.
Oligodendrocytes produce myelin in the central nervous system.
The transcription factor Sox10 is an essential component of the myelin-specific regulatory network.
Myrf is an oligodendrocyte-specific target of Sox10.
The Sox10 responsive enhancer is located in an evolutionarily conserved element in intron 1 of the Myrf gene.
Myrf cooperates with Sox10 to implement the myelination program through physical interaction between both proteins and synergistic activation of several myelin-specific genes.
The regulatory network for myelination in oligodendrocytes is organized along similar general principles as the one in Schwann cells but is differentially implemented.
In Schwann cells, Sox10 first induces and then cooperates with Krox20 during myelination.
Both Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes have a regulatory network for myelination and involve Sox10; however, they differ in their implementation.
Neurons collect their inputs from other neurons by sending out arborized dendritic structures.
The relationship between the shape of dendrites and the precise organization of synaptic inputs remains unclear.
Inputs could be distributed in tight clusters, entirely randomly, or in a regular grid-like manner.
The regularity index R is used to characterize the spatial distribution of branch and termination points by calculating average nearest neighbor distances.
The distributions of branch and termination points depend strongly on cell types, suggesting possible fundamental differences in synaptic input organization.
The regularity index R is only weakly correlated with other branching statistics, indicating it may reflect features of dendritic morphology not captured by commonly studied statistics.
Morphological models based on optimal wiring principles study the relation between input distributions and dendritic branching structures.
Branch point distributions correlate more closely with input distributions, while termination points in dendrites are generally spread out more randomly with a close to uniform distribution.
The model predictions are validated with connectome data.
With increasing regularity in spatial input distributions, characteristic scaling relationships between branching features are altered significantly.
Zinc deficiency increases susceptibility to bacterial infection.
Zinc supplementation therapies can reduce the impact of disease by providing the essential mineral to the body.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is prevalent in regions with zinc deficiency.
Dietary zinc levels dictate the outcome of S. pneumoniae infection in a murine model.
Dietary zinc restriction alters the distribution of zinc levels in murine tissues post-infection.
Dietary zinc restriction enhances S. pneumoniae virulence and infection.
Zinc restriction does not affect the activation and infiltration of murine phagocytic cells.
Zinc restriction compromises the efficacy of bacterial control by murine phagocytic cells.
S. pneumoniae is highly sensitive to zinc intoxication.
Zinc plays a role as a component of host antimicrobial defenses.
Previous studies have primarily focused on antisense transcription initiating upstream of genes.
The researchers investigated promoter-proximal antisense transcription downstream of gene transcription start sites in human breast cancer cells.
Antisense transcription downstream of promoters is widespread, with antisense transcription initiation observed within 2 kb of 28% of gene transcription start sites.
Antisense transcription initiates between nucleosomes regularly positioned downstream of these promoters.
The nucleosomes between gene and downstream antisense transcription start sites carry histone modifications associated with active promoters, such as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac.
The region between gene and downstream antisense transcription start sites is bound by chromatin remodeling and histone modifying complexes, including SWI/SNF subunits and HDACs.
The presence of these complexes suggests that antisense transcription or resulting RNA transcripts contribute to the creation and maintenance of a promoter-associated chromatin environment.
Downstream antisense transcription overlays additional regulatory features such as transcription factor binding, DNA accessibility, and the downstream edge of promoter-associated CpG islands.
Antisense transcription may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression.
Antisense transcription may contribute to the maintenance of a promoter-associated chromatin environment.
Dengue.
Approximately 80% of dengue cases in the Americas are reported in Brazil.
The four serotypes of dengue virus are DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4.
A total of 5,944,270 dengue cases have been reported in Brazil since the introduction of the virus.
There have been 21,596 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 874 fatal cases reported in Brazil.
The goal of the study was to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool to detect dengue virus in tissue specimens from previously confirmed dengue fatal cases.
A total of 74 tissue specimens were available for analysis.
The three tests evaluated were Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip.
The NS1 Ag Strip showed the highest sensitivity, detecting NS1 in 78.3% (58/74) of the specimens analyzed.
The DENV NS1 capture assay is described as a rapid and valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation, which can be useful for disease surveillance in cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and fatal cases.
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of a crowdsourced HIV intervention on HIV testing uptake among men who have sex with men (MSM) in eight Chinese cities.
The HIV testing intervention was developed through a national image contest, a regional strategy designathon, and local message contests.
The study was conducted in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Jiangmen in Guangdong province, as well as Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, and Jining in Shandong province.
MSM were recruited through Blued, a social networking mobile application for MSM.
The primary outcome measure was self-reported HIV testing in the past 3 months.
The secondary outcomes included HIV self-testing, facility-based HIV testing, condom use, and syphilis testing.
The intervention was evaluated using a closed cohort stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Yes, the intervention resulted in a 8.9% increase in the proportion of individuals receiving an HIV test during the intervention periods compared to the control periods.
The intervention increased HIV self-testing by a risk ratio of 1.89.
The study had limitations including the use of self-reported HIV testing data, non-completion of the final survey by some participants, and the relevance of findings to other populations needing further investigation.
CMVs capture genes from their hosts to employ the derived proteins for evading host immune defenses.
Researchers have recently reported the presence of CD48 homologs (vCD48s) encoded by different pathogenic viruses, including CMVs.
CD48, a cosignaling molecule, modulates the function of natural killer (NK) and other cytotoxic cells in hematopoietic cells.
The vCD48 known as A43 is encoded by owl monkey CMV.
A43 is released from the cell after being proteolytically processed through its membrane proximal region.
A43 is expressed with immediate-early kinetics, leading to its rapid detection in the supernatant of infected cells.
Surface plasmon resonance assays reveal that viral protein A43 binds to host 2B4 with high affinity and slow dissociation rates.
Soluble A43 is capable of abrogating host CD48:2B4 interactions and strongly binds to human 2B4, preventing 2B4-mediated NK-cell adhesion to target cells.
The binding of A43 to human 2B4 reduces the formation of conjugates and the establishment of immunological synapses between human NK cells and CD48-expressing target cells.
In the presence of A43, 2B4-mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production by NK cells are severely impaired.
Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are responsible for synthesizing large amounts of lipids and proteins for myelination of axons.
Myelin membranes are believed to be cell-autonomously assembled by axon-associated glial cells, specifically oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells.
The researchers found that a substantial fraction of the lipids incorporated into central nervous system (CNS) myelin are contributed by astrocytes, rather than just oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells.
SCAP is an essential coactivator of the transcription factor SREBP, which plays a role in lipid biosynthesis required for CNS myelination.
Inactivation of SCAP in oligodendrocytes resulted in significantly retarded CNS myelination.
Yes, myelin appeared normal at 3 months of age, despite the retarded myelination process.
Embryonic deletion of SCAP in astrocytes caused persistent hypomyelination.
Yes, deletion of SCAP from astrocytes during postnatal development also resulted in hypomyelination.
When astroglial lipid synthesis was inhibited, oligodendrocytes started incorporating circulating lipids into myelin membranes.
A lipid-enriched diet was sufficient to rescue hypomyelination in conditional mouse mutants.
Correlation patterns in multiple sequence alignments can be exploited to infer information about the three-dimensional structure of homologous proteins.
The three dimensions of contact prediction in the typical pipeline are (i) filtering and aligning the raw sequence data, (ii) choosing a predictive model to describe the sequence alignment, and (iii) inferring the model parameters and interpreting them in terms of structural properties.
All three dimensions are important for overall prediction success because each dimension contributes to improving the accuracy of the predictions, and neglecting any dimension may lead to suboptimal results.
The field has traditionally focused on pair-wise Potts models from statistical physics for contact prediction.
It is possible to improve significantly along the second dimension (choice of predictive model) by going beyond the traditional pair-wise Potts models and considering other extensions that are better suited to handle the presence of long stretches of gaps in multiple sequence alignments.
The extensions proposed in the paper are motivated by the observation that multiple sequence alignments often contain long stretches of gaps, which deviate from the typical data feature of independent samples drawn from a Potts model.
The purpose of using a large test set of proteins is to evaluate and demonstrate the combined improvements along the three dimensions of the predictive pipeline, and to compare the results with previous studies.
The combined improvements along the three dimensions are shown to be as large as any reported to date, indicating significant progress in contact prediction accuracy.
The three dimensions of contact prediction include filtering and aligning sequence data, choosing a predictive model, and inferring and interpreting model parameters in terms of structural properties.
Long stretches of gaps in multiple sequence alignments are considered untypical for independent samples drawn from a Potts model.
HTNV infection in humans is a serious public health concern in Asia.
A potent T cell activation peptide vaccine from HTNV structure protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control.
The T cell epitopes of the HTNV restricted by the HLA alleles remain largely unexplored.
Five well-conserved novel CD8+ T-cell epitopes of the HTNV nucleoprotein were defined.
The epitopes aa129–aa137 and aa131–aa139 are restricted by HLA-A2 and B35, respectively.
The method used to evaluate the epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell response was HLA-peptide pentamer complex staining.
The frequency of epitope-specific pentamer+ CD8+ T-cell response was much higher in mild/moderate patients than in severe/critical ones at the acute stage of the disease.
The frequency of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells at the acute stage is inversely associated with the peak level of serum creatinine and positively associated with the nadir platelet counts during the hospitalization.
Effective epitope-specific CD8+ T cells are characterized by the production of interferon-γ, expression of CD69, and the strong capacity of proliferation.
The novel HLA class I restricted HTNV nucleoprotein epitopes-specific CD8+ T-cell responses could provide the first step toward effective peptide vaccine development against HTNV infection in humans.
The genetic basis of sex differences in schizophrenia has not been identified.

Yes, it showed a significant gene-sex effect.
Four additional populations were studied to validate the initial results.
Yes, the replication study confirmed the initial result.
The estimated relative risk for women carrying the common genotype is 1.58.
No, the female-specific association between RELN and schizophrenia is one of the few examples of a replicated sex-specific genetic association in any disease.
No, the association was observed only in women.
The p-value for the gene-sex interaction in women based on all populations was 1.6 × 10−5.

A sodium/substrate symporter.
No, it does not.
Transporting histatin 5, a highly cytotoxic antimicrobial peptide.
Terminal differentiation of B cells is essential for the humoral immune response in vertebrates.
Terminal differentiation of B cells is achieved through the concerted action of several transcription factors in response to antigen recognition and extracellular signals provided by T-helper cells.
There is no general consensus regarding the structure and dynamical properties of the underlying regulatory network controlling the process of B cell terminal differentiation.
The researchers developed a dynamical model of the regulatory network based on experimental data available in the literature.
The model accounts for the differentiation of Naive, GC (Germinal Center), Mem (Memory), and PC (Plasma Cell) types of B cells.
Yes, the models show consistency with the patterns of activation observed for Naive, GC, Mem, and PC cell types.
The models describe the differentiation from the precursor Naive to any of the GC, Mem, or PC cell types in response to a specific set of extracellular signals.
The model highlights the importance of Pax5, Bcl6, Bach2, Irf4, and Blimp1 as key regulators of B cell differentiation process.
The researchers simulated all possible single loss- and gain-of-function mutants to confirm the importance of the identified key regulators in B cell differentiation.
The model qualitatively describes the directional nature of terminal B cell differentiation and key differentiation events from a precursor cell to terminally differentiated B cells.
The main topic of the text is the link between high carbohydrate diets and heart dysfunction.
The three elements combined in the study are diet, genetics, and physiology.
The study used adult Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) as a model organism.
The effects observed included deterioration of heart function, fibrosis-like collagen accumulation, insulin signaling defects, and fat accumulation.
The reduction of insulin and P38 signaling resulted in a more severe and shorter life span in the fruit flies.
The hexosamine flux, a metabolic pathway accessed by glucose, was found to play a role in heart function defects.
Increased hexosamine flux led to heart function defects and structural damage in the fruit flies.
Reduction of pathway activity in the heart prevented sugar-induced heart dysfunction.
The use of Drosophila as a model system allows researchers to explore specific aspects of diet-induced heart dysfunction.
Enzymes within the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway have been identified as potential therapeutic targets.
