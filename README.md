# Bio-QFS

### Dataset of our paper: Query-Focused Summarization for Efficient Biomedical Literature Reading

### The Bio-QFS dataset includes three files: the original biomedical articles, a set of questions generated by our data construction pipeline that capture the core content of each article, and the corresponding answers.

### To safeguard our intellectual property, we have temporarily released only a subset of the dataset. The complete version will be made publicly available following the publication of the related paper, as a contribution to the research community.
