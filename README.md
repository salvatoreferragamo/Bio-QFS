# Bio-QFS

### Dataset of our paper: Query-Focused Summarization for Efficient Biomedical Literature Reading

### For Bio-QFS Dataset, there are three columns of data. The first column is Query, the second column is summary, and the third column is Document. In the document, we split it as a list.

### To safeguard our intellectual property, we have temporarily released only a subset of the dataset. The complete version will be made publicly available following the publication of the related paper, as a contribution to the research community.
